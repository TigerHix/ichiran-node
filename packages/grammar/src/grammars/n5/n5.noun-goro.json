  "explanation": "### Name\n- 〜ごろ（時間・年齢の目安）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Marks an approximate point in time or age: around/about (time), roughly (age)\n\n### Form and templates\n- N(time/age) + ごろ\n- N(time/age) + ごろ + に (optional “at”)\n- N(time/age) + ごろ + から/まで/には/までに/は/も\n- Question words + ごろ (e.g., いつごろ, 何時ごろ, 何歳ごろ)\n- Predicate use: N(time/age) + ごろ + です/でした is possible\n- Particle order: attach particles after ごろ (ごろに, ごろから, ごろまで, ごろには, ごろまでに)\n- Target N(time/age): clock times, days/dates, months/years/seasons, parts of the day, holidays, ages\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register: neutral; natural in both speech and writing; very common at all politeness levels\n- Semantics: indicates an approximate point in time (not a duration/length). Use for when something happens, not how long it lasts\n- ごろ vs ぐらい:\n  - ごろ: approximate point in time/age\n  - ぐらい/くらい: approximate amount/degree/duration; can also mark approximate time, but use ごろ when you specifically mean “at around (time)”\n- ごろ vs ころ:\n  - ごろ attaches to time/age nouns (often with numerals/counters)\n  - ころ attaches to clauses or broader time nouns/phrases to mean “around the time when …”\n- Particle behavior: に after ごろ is optional; other particles also come after ごろ (not before)\n- Combination range: ごろから〜ごろまで is fine to show an approximate span bounded by two approximate points\n- Orthography:\n  - Hiragana ごろ is standard and safest\n  - Kanji 頃 appears in writing\n  - ころ is a variant; with numerals/time words, ごろ is generally preferred\n  - Fixed phrase このごろ/この頃 means “these days” (set expression; not the same as the suffix ごろ)\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Using ごろ with durations: × 三時間ごろ → use 〜時間ぐらい/くらい for durations\n- Using ごろ with quantities/people: × 三人ごろ → use 〜人ぐらい/くらい\n- Misplacing particles: × にごろ → correct order is ごろに\n- Using ごろ after a clause: after verbs/clauses use ころ, not ごろ\n- Redundant stacking of approximators (e.g., heavy use of だいたい + ごろ) can sound wordy\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- 〜ぐらい／〜くらい: approximate amount/degree/duration; can also approximate time but is broader than ごろ\n- 〜ころ: “around the time when …”; attaches to clauses or general time phrases (e.g., 学生のころ)\n- N + 前後: “around/approximately” with numbers or times; more formal/written than ごろ",
