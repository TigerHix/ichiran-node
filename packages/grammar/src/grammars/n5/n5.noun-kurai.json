  "explanation": "### Name\n- N＋くらい／ぐらい（およその数量・程度）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Gives a rough amount, number, price, distance, duration, or time point: “about/around/approximately”\n- With は: sets a minimal expectation or lower bound: “at least …”\n- With も: emphasizes a large amount/degree: “as many/much as …”\n\n### Form and templates\n- N(quantity/amount/number＋counter, price, distance, duration, frequency, time point)＋くらい／ぐらい\n- Time point＋くらい／ぐらい＋に … (when marking the time an action occurs)\n- N＋くらい／ぐらい＋は … (minimum: “at least …”)\n- N＋くらい／ぐらい＋も … (emphasis: “as many/much as …”)\n- N＋くらい／ぐらい＋から／まで … (ranges)\n- Demonstratives and interrogatives: これ／それ／あれ＋くらい／ぐらい; どれくらい／どのくらい (to ask “how much/how long”)\n- Particle order: くらい／ぐらい comes immediately after the noun/number it modifies; topic/focus/case particles follow (…くらい＋は/も/に/で/から/まで…)\n- くらい and ぐらい are interchangeable; ぐらい is more colloquial. No conjugation is needed.\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register/naturalness: Very common in both polite and casual speech. くらい is neutral and common in writing; ぐらい sounds more conversational.\n- Scope: It modifies the immediately preceding amount/time; keep it directly after that word.\n- Counters: Use the appropriate counter with numbers before adding くらい／ぐらい (people, hours, times, yen, kilometers, etc.).\n- Time expressions:\n  - For specific clock times/dates, ごろ is also common/preferred; くらい is acceptable. When an action’s time must be marked, add に after N＋くらい (if the verb requires it).\n  - ごろ is only for time points; it cannot be used with amounts or durations. くらい works with both durations and time points.\n- “At least” nuance: N＋くらい＋は clearly signals a minimum; can be reinforced with せめて or 少なくとも.\n- Emphasis with も: N＋くらい＋も highlights a surprisingly large quantity/degree.\n- Do not stack approximators: Choose one of くらい／ぐらい, 約, およそ, だいたい, 程度; avoid combinations like 約…くらい in careful usage.\n- Orthography: Write くらい／ぐらい in hiragana for this particle; avoid the kanji 位 here.\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Placing くらい／ぐらい before the noun/number; it must follow the element it approximates.\n- Omitting the required counter with numbers before adding くらい／ぐらい.\n- Using ごろ with amounts or durations (ごろ is for specific times only).\n- Forgetting に after a clock-time phrase with くらい when the verb requires a time marker.\n- Confusing くらい (“about/at least”) with だけ (“only,” limitation rather than approximation).\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- N＋ごろ／ころ: “around (a specific time/date)” only; not for amounts/durations.\n- N＋ほど: “about; to the extent of,” a bit more formal/objective; common with durations/quantities; not typically used for specific clock times.\n- N＋ばかり: “about; roughly; only/just,” often implying smallness/limitation.\n- N＋程度（ていど）: “approximately; on the order of,” formal/written alternative to くらい.",
