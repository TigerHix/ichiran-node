  "explanation": "### Name\n- 逆接の「けれども／けど」\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Expresses a contrast or concession between two statements: but; although; however\n- The second clause is usually the speaker’s main point or the result that holds despite the first clause\n\n### Form and templates\n- V(plain) + けど／けれど／けれども + S2\n- い-adj + けど／けれど／けれども + S2\n- な-adj + だ + けど／けれど／けれども + S2 → contracts to だけど／だけれど／だけれども\n- N + だ + けど／けれど／けれども + S2 → contracts to だけど／だけれど／だけれども\n- Polite linkage: Clause + です／ます + が／けれども + S2\n- Alternatives and nuance:\n  - けど: shortest, most casual, very common in speech\n  - けれど: neutral–slightly formal/softer than けど\n  - けれども: most formal/softened in this family; common with です／ます\n  - が: formal/written-leaning conjunction used mid-sentence, especially after です／ます\n- Conjugation notes:\n  - Any tense or polarity can precede けど/けれども (past 〜た, negative 〜ない, etc.)\n  - With N/な-adj in plain style, keep だ before けど/けれども (→ だけど/だけれども). In polite style use です + が／けれども\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register:\n  - けど: casual; acceptable even after です／ます in everyday conversation (ですけど)\n  - けれど／けれども: more careful/polite; pairs well with です／ます\n  - が: polite and common in writing or formal speech\n- Discourse scope:\n  - Clause order matters; the important or surprising point typically comes after けど／が\n  - Can also preface a request or soften a statement when combined with です／ます or 〜んです\n- Choice among variants:\n  - Everyday speech: けど is most frequent\n  - Formal talk/writing: が or けれども preferred\n  - けれど is in-between and less frequent than けど in casual speech\n- Orthography:\n  - Usually written in hiragana: けど／けれど／けれども\n  - 然れども is archaic/literary and generally avoided at N5\n- Placement:\n  - けど／けれども/が link two clauses within one sentence. For sentence-initial “However,” でも or しかし is used instead (related item)\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Omitting だ before けど/けれども with N/な-adj in plain style (use だけど/だけれども, or です + が／けれども in polite style)\n- Doubling contrast markers (e.g., using けど and でも/しかし together for the same contrast)\n- Overusing casual けど in formal emails; prefer ですが／けれども\n- Assuming けど always indicates strong contradiction; it can be a mild contrast or softener. For a stronger “even though,” see のに (higher level)\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- でも: Sentence-initial “however/but”; connects separate sentences, more emphatic break\n- が: Mid-sentence “but” after です／ます; formal/written-leaning\n- のに: Stronger “even though/ despite,” often expresses unexpectedness or frustration (N4)\n- しかし: Formal sentence-initial “however,” common in writing and presentations",
