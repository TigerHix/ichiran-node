  "explanation": "### Name\n- 名詞＋で（場所・手段）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Marks where an action/event takes place: “at/in/on”\n- Marks means, method, instrument, vehicle, or language: “by/with/using/in”\n- Also used for group size/composition (“as a group of …”) and often for material (“made of …”)\n\n### Form and templates\n- N(place)＋で＋V(action)\n- N(tool/vehicle/language/material)＋で＋V\n- N(number/group)＋で＋V\n- N(price/amount/time needed)＋で＋V [often learned later]\n- Particle behavior:\n  - で attaches directly to the noun (or full noun phrase) it marks.\n  - Multiple adverbial phrases can stack; a common order is Time ＞ Place(〜で) ＞ Means(〜で) ＞ Object ＞ Verb, but word order is flexible.\n- Alternations/choices:\n  - Place: use で for actions/events; use に for existence/state (いる・ある) or destinations with motion verbs (に／へ).\n  - Material: で emphasizes the material used; から is preferred when emphasizing transformation from a source.\n  - Means: で is the default; を使って is a more explicit “by using,” and によって is formal/advanced.\n- Conjugation/inflection:\n  - で here is a case particle; it does not conjugate and is independent of politeness.\n  - Do not confuse with で as the て-form of だ (for nouns/な-adjectives in linking).\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register and frequency: Neutral and extremely common in speech and writing at all politeness levels.\n- Semantic scope:\n  - Place で requires an action/event sense; it does not mark static location or residence.\n  - Means で covers tools, vehicles, media, languages, and body parts used to perform an action.\n  - Group で indicates doing something “as/with” a number or group.\n  - Cause/reason で (with event-type nouns) exists but is typically introduced later.\n- Not for time points: Do not use で for specific times/days; use に. で with durations can mean “in/within [time] (to complete),” which is commonly learned later.\n- Orthography: で is always written in hiragana.\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Using で instead of に with verbs of existence/state (いる・ある・住むなど).\n- Using で to mark destinations; use に／へ with motion verbs.\n- Using で to mark the agent “by” in passive sentences; use に.\n- Confusing the particle で with the て-form of だ (e.g., after nouns/な-adjectives).\n- Misreading 何で as “why” (colloquial なんで) when it can also mean “by what means”; be aware of the ambiguity from context.\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- 名詞＋に: location of existence/state; destination; point in time.\n- 名詞＋へ: direction/toward (destination).\n- 名詞＋を使って: explicit “by using …” (means/instrument).\n- 名詞＋から vs 名詞＋で (材料): から emphasizes origin/source or transformation; で emphasizes material used.\n- （名詞/な形容詞）＋で (て-form of だ): linker for clauses; different from the particle で.",
