  "explanation": "### Name\n- よく（頻度／上手さ）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Often/frequently: indicates a high frequency or habitual repetition of an action\n- Well/skillfully/thoroughly: indicates good quality, clarity, or carefulness of an action or result\n- In set phrases, can function as praise or evaluation (e.g., “did well”), but this use is formulaic\n\n### Form and templates\n- Core\n  - よく V(dict/ます)\n  - S は よく V\n  - N を よく V\n  - N が よく V\n- Past/habitual\n  - よく V-た／よく V-ていた (frequent or habitual action in the past)\n- Negative (quality, not frequency)\n  - よく V-ない (means “not well,” not “not often”)\n- Meaning disambiguation by verb type\n  - Action/volitional verbs → frequency reading is common (“often”)\n  - Perception/ability/resultative verbs (見える・聞こえる・分かる・できる・知っている など) → manner/degree reading (“well/clearly”)\n  - With ある/見られる など (stative/passive) → often “frequently/commonly”\n- Placement/ordering\n  - Typically after the topic (X は) and before the main verb phrase\n  - Can appear before or after the object: N を よく V / よく N を V (both natural). Keep it within the predicate; do not split a noun from its particle\n- Conjugation\n  - よく itself does not conjugate. Politeness, tense, and polarity are carried by the verb\n- Orthography\n  - Adverb: usually written in hiragana よく\n  - As the negative of いい/よい: よくない／良くない (predicate “not good,” different from the adverbial use)\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register: neutral and widely used in both plain and polite speech\n- Frequency vs manner:\n  - With everyday actions and time context → “often”\n  - With cognition/perception/ability → “well, clearly, thoroughly”\n  - Some verbs can be ambiguous (e.g., actions that could be done “often” or “well”); context resolves the meaning or add another adverb for clarity\n- Habitual past: よく V-た／V-ていた commonly conveys “used to (often) …”\n- For “not often,” prefer あまり〜ない or めったに〜ない; よく〜ない expresses “not well,” not low frequency\n- Related nuance words:\n  - “Well/properly” with a normative flavor: ちゃんと／しっかり\n  - “Skillfully”: 上手に／うまく (more explicit than よく for ability)\n  - “A lot (quantity)” is たくさん, not よく (which is frequency or manner)\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Using よく〜ない to mean “not often” (should be あまり〜ない／めったに〜ない). よく〜ない means “not well”\n- Trying to modify most adjectives with よく (use とても/かなり/けっこう etc. for adjective degree). よくない is the irregular negative of いい/よい, not adverb + ない\n- Overusing the kanji 良く for the adverb; hiragana よく is standard\n- Ambiguity with verbs that allow both readings (“often” vs “well”); add a clearer adverb if needed (たいてい/いつも for frequency; ちゃんと/うまく for manner)\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- いつも: “always” (higher frequency than よく)\n- たいてい: “usually/generally” (default tendency; milder than よく’s “often”)\n- 時々／たまに: “sometimes/occasionally” (lower frequency than よく)\n- あまり〜ない／めったに〜ない: “not much/often” (negative-frequency expressions)\n- ちゃんと／しっかり: “properly/firmly” (manner, not frequency)\n- 上手に／うまく: “skillfully/well” (clearer ability/manner than よく)\n- たくさん: “a lot/much/many” (quantity, not frequency)",
