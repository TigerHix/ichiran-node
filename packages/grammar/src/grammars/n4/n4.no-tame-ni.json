  "explanation": "### Name\n- 〜ために（目的・理由）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Expresses two core uses:\n  - Purpose/benefit: in order to; for the sake/benefit of\n  - Reason/cause: because; due to; as a result of\n\n### Form and templates\n- Purpose/benefit\n  - V(dict) + ために\n    - Purpose the speaker/subject intends to achieve\n  - N + のために\n    - For the sake/benefit of N (person/group/goal)\n  - Main clause typically shows an intentional action, plan, request, permission, or preparation by the same subject as in the ため-clause\n\n- Reason/cause\n  - V(plain, often past for realized causes) + ため(に)\n  - い-adj + ため(に)\n  - な-adj + な + ため(に)\n  - N + のため(に)\n  - States an objective cause; the result clause can be non-volitional or a factual outcome. “に” after ため is optional here; without “に” is slightly more formal/written\n\n- Attributive/topic variants\n  - V(dict) + ための + N; N + のための + N\n    - N for the purpose of …\n  - V(dict)/N + の + ためには …\n    - As for/in order to … (topic), often followed by advice/requirements\n\n- Particle and ordering notes\n  - の links a noun to ため; な links a な-adjective to ため\n  - ため behaves as a noun: ために, ための, ためは/ためには are all possible\n  - For purpose, keep “に” (ために). For cause, “に” may be omitted (ため) in more formal writing\n\n- Conjugation/inflection\n  - Verbs before ため(に) are plain form; past form is common in the cause use for completed causes\n  - い-adjectives stay in their dictionary form before ため\n  - な-adjectives take な before ため\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Distinguishing purpose vs reason\n  - Purpose: main clause is volitional/controllable and shares the same subject as the ため-clause; often “benefit” nuance with N + のために\n  - Reason: no subject restriction; often non-volitional result; more objective/formal than から/ので\n- Volitional vs potential/state\n  - For purpose, avoid potential forms or uncontrollable/stative predicates before ために; use 〜ように for “so that can/so that it will …”\n- Register and naturalness\n  - ために (purpose) is neutral and common\n  - ため(に) (reason) sounds more formal/objective than から/ので and is frequent in writing, news, and announcements\n  - Dropping “に” (ため) increases formality and is most natural in the reason/cause use\n- Ambiguity\n  - N + のために can mean “for the sake of N” (benefit) or “because of N” (cause); context resolves it. Animate N often reads as benefit; inanimate/event N often reads as cause\n- Orthography\n  - Usually written in hiragana: ため(に). The kanji 為 is rare in modern writing outside set phrases and formal documents\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Using ために (purpose) with potential or uncontrollable predicates; prefer 〜ように\n- Mixing subjects in the purpose use; purpose normally requires the same subject across clauses\n- Omitting “に” in the purpose use (V + ため); this sounds awkward—keep ために\n- Overusing ため(に) for casual reasons in conversation where から/ので are more natural\n- Using ため(に) (reason) with requests/commands; in such contexts から/ので are more natural\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- 〜ように: “so that,” used with potentials/non-volitional outcomes; contrasts with ために which prefers volitional purpose\n- 〜から／〜ので: Casual/formal “because”; more conversational and flexible with requests/suggestions than ため(に)\n- 〜おかげで／〜せいで: Positive vs negative cause; ため(に) is neutral/objective\n- 〜にとって: “for; to” in the sense of viewpoint/assessment, not purpose/benefit\n- 〜に (purpose with motion verbs): Simple “to/for (the purpose of)” tied to movement; narrower than ために",
