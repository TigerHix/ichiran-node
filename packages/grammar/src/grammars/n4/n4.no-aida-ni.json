  "explanation": "### Name\n- 〜の間に（あいだに）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- “During; at some point within.” Marks a defined time span within which the main event happens once or intermittently (not necessarily for the whole period).\n- Also “between (time A) and (time B),” indicating an occurrence somewhere inside that interval.\n\n### Form and templates\n- N(time period) + の間に + [event/clause]\n  - N should denote a bounded span (holidays, seasons, trips, meetings, classes, weekends, date ranges, clock times, etc.).\n- Time A から Time B まで の間に + [event/clause]\n  - Clear way to express “between A and B (in time).”\n- Optional/topic particles:\n  - …の間に は: topicalizes/contrasts the time span.\n  - …の間に も: “also/too during…”\n- Alternations:\n  - N + の間 (no に): the action/state continues throughout the entire span.\n  - N + の間は: “as long as …,” topic-marked, often contrastive.\n- Orthography:\n  - 間 is read あいだ. Both の間に and のあいだに are acceptable.\n- No verb conjugation issues here; this is a nominal time expression.\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register: Neutral and common in both speech and writing; works with plain or polite predicates.\n- Semantic scope:\n  - Use の間に when the event is punctual or occurs at one/more points within the period. For continuous states covering the whole span, use の間 or 〜中.\n  - For compact deadlines (“by today/this week/5 o’clock”), 〜中に or 〜までに is often more natural than の間に.\n- Time nouns:\n  - Suits clearly bounded periods (breaks, classes, meetings, trips, seasons, specific hours). For broad life stages/ages, とき or ころ is usually preferred.\n- “Between A and B”:\n  - For times, A から B までの間に is unambiguous. A と B の間に is typically spatial (“between A and B” in space).\n- Collocations:\n  - Frequency/adverb markers like よく, ときどき, たまに can co-occur.\n  - いつの間にか is a fixed expression meaning “before I knew it/without noticing,” built on the same pattern.\n- Particles:\n  - は/も after の間に add contrast/emphasis without changing core meaning.\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Omitting の (N 間に ×). Always use N の間に.\n- Using の間に when the situation lasts the whole time; use の間 or 〜中 instead.\n- Using A と B の間に for time ranges; this is read as spatial—prefer A から B までの間に for times.\n- Overusing の間に for life stages (e.g., “childhood”); とき/ころ is often more natural.\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- 〜の間: “during/while” for something that holds throughout the whole span.\n- 〜の間は: “as long as …,” topic-marked and often contrastive.\n- 〜最中に: “right in the middle of …,” often implying interruption/inconvenience.\n- 〜中／〜中に: 〜中 = “throughout; the whole time,” 〜中に = “within/by (deadline)” for compact time frames.\n- 〜うちに: “while (before the state changes),” focusing on a window of opportunity rather than a fixed span.",
