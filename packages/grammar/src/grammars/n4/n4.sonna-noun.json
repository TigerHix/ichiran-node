  "explanation": "### Name\n- そんな＋名詞\n\n### Meaning and function\n- “That kind/sort/type of N.” Refers to a category, quality, or manner associated with the listener, something just mentioned in the discourse, or situationally given. Often carries the speaker’s evaluation of the noun.\n\n### Form and templates\n- Core:\n  - そんな + N\n- Elliptical/standalone (when the noun is omitted):\n  - そんな + の (casual, catch-all “that kind of thing”)\n  - そんな + こと (abstract “that kind of matter/action”)\n  - そんな + もの (concrete or dismissive “such a thing”)\n- Formal/near-synonyms:\n  - そのような + N (more formal, neutral)\n  - そういう + N (close in meaning, discourse-based “that kind of”)\n- Particle placement and order:\n  - そんな directly precedes the noun it modifies.\n  - Particles attach to the noun as usual: そんな + N + は/が/を/に/で/と/から/まで/も, etc.\n- Conjugation/inflection:\n  - そんな does not conjugate and is not a な-adjective. Do not add な or treat it as a predicate by itself.\n  - For degree with adjectives/verbs, use そんなに (adverb), not そんな.\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register and naturalness:\n  - Very common and natural in everyday speech; fine in polite conversation. In formal writing or official contexts, prefer そのような or そういった.\n- Semantic scope:\n  - Describes type/quality, not a specific identified item. Use その + N for a specific “that N,” and そんな + N for “that kind of N.”\n  - “そ-” points to something associated with the listener or already mentioned; こんな is speaker-side, あんな is distant/removed.\n  - こんな/そんな/あんな can reflect the speaker’s feelings; そんな may sound neutral or slightly distancing/critical depending on context.\n- Constraints:\n  - Modifies nouns only. To modify adjectives/verbs (degree/extent), use そんなに.\n  - When used pronominally (no explicit noun), add の/こと/もの; plain そんな alone is incomplete in standard usage.\n- Orthography:\n  - Typically written in kana: そんな. For formal alternatives, そのような is common (よう usually in kana; 様 in kanji is also seen). Archaic spellings like 其んな are not used.\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Confusing その + N (specific “that N”) with そんな + N (“that kind of N”).\n- Using そんな directly with adjectives/verbs; for degree use そんなに, or nominalize to use そんな + N.\n- Treating そんな as a な-adjective or predicate: forms like “そんななN” or “そんなです/だ” are incorrect.\n- Dropping the nominal element when standing alone: use そんなの/そんなこと/そんなもの; plain そんな is incomplete.\n- Overusing そんな in formal writing; choose そのような/そういった for a more formal tone.\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- こんな + N／あんな + N／どんな + N: “this kind of,” “that kind (distant/removed),” and “what kind of.” Contrasts by deictic distance and interrogative use.\n- そういう + N／そのような + N: Near-synonyms meaning “that kind of” based on discourse; そういう is neutral/casual, そのような is more formal.\n- その + N: “that (specific) N,” identifying a particular item, not a type.\n- そんなに + Adj/V: Adverb meaning “so/that much”; different function from そんな + N.",
