  "explanation": "### Name\n- 〜は大変です\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Says that something (a task, situation, schedule, life, etc.) is tough, hard, or burdensome. Often also shows sympathy/empathy about someone’s situation.\n\n### Form and templates\n- N は 大変です\n- 大変な N\n- [Optional/early] V(plain) の は 大変です\n- Polite/plain:\n  - 大変です / 大変だ\n  - Past: 大変でした / 大変だった\n  - Negative: 大変ではありません・大変じゃないです\n- Particle and order:\n  - Topic は marks what is tough. が is also possible when focusing or answering “what is tough,” but は is the default.\n  - When modifying a noun, use the な form: 大変な + N (not 大変の).\n- Alternatives/variants:\n  - Orthography: 大変／たいへん (both common at N5; kanji is standard in print).\n  - With actions as topics, の nominalizes the verb: V(plain) の は 大変です. This is common but may feel a half-step beyond the very first N5 patterns.\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register: Neutral and common in both speech and writing. Polite です/ます is frequent in conversation. Plain 大変だ is casual.\n- Naturalness: Very common for workloads, schedules, living conditions, and “overall burden.” It can also be used empathically (大変ですね) to respond to someone’s hardship.\n- Semantics:\n  - Emphasizes burden/strain rather than intellectual difficulty. For “hard to solve/understand,” 難しい is more precise.\n  - For emotional or physical suffering, つらい may be better.\n- Intensifiers: Often combines with とても／本当に／すごく to adjust strength. Without an adverb, 大変 can sound quite strong; ちょっと can soften it.\n- Other meanings: As an interjection (大変です！) it can mean “This is terrible!”—a separate, urgent-use nuance.\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Forgetting な before a noun (use 大変な N; not 大変N or 大変のN).\n- Using を before 大変です (*N を 大変です is ungrammatical). Use は (topic) or が (focus).\n- Overusing 大変 for things that are merely “difficult to understand/solve”; use 難しい there.\n- Describing a person as 大変です can sound odd or carry a different meaning; it’s more natural to make the task/situation the topic.\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- 難しい: “difficult” in the sense of challenging to understand/solve; objective difficulty.\n- つらい: “painful/trying” emotionally or physically.\n- きつい: Colloquial “tough/harsh,” often about workload/conditions; more casual than 大変.\n- 楽(らく)だ: “easy/comfortable,” the opposite in terms of burden.",
