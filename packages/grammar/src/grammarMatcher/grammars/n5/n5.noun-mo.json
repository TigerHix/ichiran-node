  "description": "Indicates that the action or state is the same for multiple items or people; 'also', 'as well'",

  "explanation": "### Name\n- 名詞＋も（追加の「も」）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Adds the meaning “also/too/as well,” indicating that the same action, state, or quality applies to another item or person. With multiple items, it highlights that they all share the predicate; with negation, it can mean “neither…nor.”\n\n### Form and templates\n- Core:\n  - Nも + V\n  - Nも + い-adj\n  - Nも + な-adj（だ／です）\n  - Nも + 名詞（だ／です）\n- Particle replacement vs. stacking:\n  - Replace は／が／を with も: Nも …\n  - Keep other case/functional particles and add も after them:\n    - Nに(も), Nへ(も), Nで(も), Nと(も), Nから(も), Nまで(も)\n- Parallel listing:\n  - N1も N2も + same predicate → “both/all … (also)”; with negative → “neither/nor …”\n  - For 3+ items: N1も N2も N3も + predicate\n- Conjugation:\n  - も does not affect verb/adjective conjugation. Use polite/casual, tense, and polarity on the predicate as usual (ます／ない／た／ている etc.).\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register/frequency: Neutral and very common in both speech and writing at all politeness levels.\n- Discourse constraint: Natural when something comparable has been stated or is understood from context. Using も as the very first mention can sound odd unless an implied set exists.\n- Semantic scope:\n  - Replacing は with も marks an “inclusive topic” (“as for X, X too”).\n  - Replacing が/を with も marks subject/object as “also.”\n  - With に／で／へ／と／から／まで + も, the inclusion applies to role (time/place/means/direction/etc.) → “also at/in/to/with/from/until …”\n- Ambiguity note:\n  - Nで(も)/Nに(も)/Nでも can also express “even” or make soft suggestions depending on context; ensure the “also” reading is supported by surrounding information.\n- Orthography: も is written in hiragana. A formal written variant 〜もまた exists but is less common in conversation.\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Combining が／を with も (e.g., Nがも, Nをも) in everyday usage; replace them with Nも. (Set phrases like をも exist in formal/literary style.)\n- Putting も before the case particle (e.g., もに); correct order is particle + も (にも).\n- Stacking は and も on the same noun (はも) in neutral sentences; instead, mark a different noun with も or structure the topic separately.\n- Assuming Nでも always means “also”; it often means “even” or is used for loose suggestions.\n- Confusing this inclusive も with other も-patterns (counters + も “as many as,” or wh-words + も yielding “every-/no-” meanings).\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- は: Topic marker; contrasts or frames the topic. も replaces は to add inclusion (“as for … also”).\n- が: Subject marker; も replaces が to add “also.”\n- を: Object marker; も replaces を to add “also.”\n- でも (Nでも): “even; or … for example; how about …” — different from simple inclusion.\n- しか〜ない: “only; nothing but,” the opposite of inclusive も.\n- Wh-word + も: Produces universal or negative meanings (“every- / no- …”) — a separate pattern from the simple “also.”",
