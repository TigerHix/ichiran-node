  "explanation": "### Name\n- いつか（不特定の時）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Refers to an unspecified point in time: “someday/one day” (future) or “at some point/once” (past). It is an indefinite time adverb.\n\n### Form and templates\n- いつか + V(non‑past)\n  - Future sense: “someday/one day …”\n- いつか + V(past)\n  - Past sense: “once/at some point …”\n- いつかは + Clause\n  - Adds topic/contrast emphasis: “someday at least / eventually …”\n- いつかの + N\n  - Adnominal use: “that time’s … / something from some time ago”\n- Particle behavior\n  - Usually no particle is needed. は is optionally added for topic/contrast (いつかは). の attaches when modifying a noun (いつかのN).\n  - に is generally not used after いつか.\n- Conjugation\n  - いつか itself does not conjugate. The verb/adjective after it takes normal tense/politeness. Non‑past → future sense; past → past sense.\n- Placement\n  - Functions as a time adverb; typically placed before the predicate or clause it modifies.\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register and naturalness\n  - Neutral and common in both speech and writing. いつかのN is more casual; avoid in very formal writing.\n- Semantic scope\n  - Ambiguous between future and past; verb tense and context resolve the meaning.\n  - Often pairs naturally with intention/hope/result expressions (〜たい, つもり, 予定, と思う, 必ず, きっと).\n  - Does not indicate “soon”; it can be far in the future. For “before long,” そのうち is more appropriate.\n  - For a single definite day in the past, prefer ある日.\n- Orthography\n  - Usually written in kana: いつか. The kanji 何時か exists but is rare/literary and best avoided at beginner level.\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Adding に after いつか (いつかに …) is unnatural in standard usage; omit に.\n- Using いつか to ask “when?”; the question word is いつ (without か).\n- Using いつか for a specific, definite past day; use ある日 instead.\n- Overusing いつかの + N in formal texts; rewrite to a full clause in formal writing.\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- いつ: “when?” (question word; no か)\n- いつも: “always/usually” (habitual)\n- いつでも: “anytime/whenever” (unrestricted time)\n- そのうち: “before long/sometime soon” (sooner than いつか)\n- いずれ: “sooner or later/eventually” (more formal/literary than いつか)\n- ある日: “one day (a particular day in the past)”\n- いつの間にか: “before one knows it/without noticing” (different nuance from いつか)",
