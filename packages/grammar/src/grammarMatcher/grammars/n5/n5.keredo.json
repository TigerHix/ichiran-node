  "explanation": "### Name\n- 逆接の けど／けれど（も）／だけど\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Links two statements to show contrast or concession: “but,” “however,” “although”\n- Also used to soften what follows, introduce a topic, or hedge a request/opinion (especially when left hanging: …けど。)\n\n### Form and templates\n- V(plain) + けど／けれど（も）\n- い-adj + けど／けれど（も）\n- な-adj + だ + けど／けれど（も）; or な-adj + です + けど／けれど（も）\n- N + だ + けど／けれど（も）; or N + です + けど／けれど（も）\n- N／な-adj + だけど／だけれど（も） (よく使う。会話的)\n- V(plain)／い-adj + の／ん + だけど (説明・前置きのニュアンスを足して会話でよく使う)\n- Negative/past forms appear before けど/けれど（も）/だけど as usual (〜ないけど, 〜たけど, 〜なかったけど, etc.)\n\n- Particle/ordering:\n  - Clause A + けど + Clause B. The main point is typically in Clause B.\n  - だけど can also start a sentence to contrast with the previous sentence: だけど、S…\n- Optional parts:\n  - も in けれども adds politeness/emphasis (けど < けれど < けれども in formality)\n  - です／ます before けど／けれど（も） is fine in polite speech (〜ですけど／〜ますけれども)\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register/naturalness:\n  - けど: very common, casual/conversational\n  - けれど: a bit more careful or written than けど\n  - けれども: polite/formal (business, public speech)\n  - だけど: conversational; often after N/な-adj or sentence-initial pivot\n  - In formal writing, が or しかし is preferred over けど\n- Semantic scope:\n  - Broad “but/though” contrast; can also just soften/introduce information rather than strong contradiction\n  - For strong “contrary to expectation” or complaint, のに is usually more appropriate than けど\n- Position:\n  - Mid-sentence connector is the default (AけどB)\n  - Sentence-final けど softens/hedges and implies something unsaid; avoid in very formal writing\n  - Sentence-initial contrast: だけど (casual), でも (neutral), しかし (formal)\n- After N/な-adj:\n  - Use だ/です before けど／けれど（も） (N/な-adj + だ/です + けど)\n  - Or attach だけど／だけれど（も） directly (N/な-adj + だけど)\n- After V/い-adj:\n  - Use けど／けれど（も）\n  - Do not attach だけど directly unless preceded by の／ん (V/い-adj + の／ん + だけど)\n- Orthography:\n  - Usually written in hiragana: けど／けれど／けれども／だけど\n  - けども exists but is less common; stick to the forms above\n\n### Common mistakes\n- Omitting だ/です before けど after N/な-adj (say N/な-adj + だ/です + けど, or use だけど)\n- Using だけど directly after verbs/い-adjectives (needs の／ん, or use けど/けれど)\n- Overusing けど in formal writing/speeches where が／しかし／けれども is expected\n- Assuming the clause before けど is the main message; in Japanese, the main point usually comes after けど\n\n### Related grammar\n- 〜が: More formal/neutral sentence-internal “but”; weaker and tighter than けど in writing\n- でも: Sentence-initial “but”; cannot directly attach to a clause like けど does\n- 〜のに: “Even though/although” with stronger sense of unexpectedness or dissatisfaction; not used as a softener\n- しかし: Formal sentence-initial “however,” common in essays and speeches",
