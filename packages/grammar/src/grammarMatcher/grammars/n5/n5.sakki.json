  "explanation": "### Name\n- さっき（直前の過去）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Refers to a very recent past time: a short while ago, just now (in the past)\n- Used to talk about something that happened a little earlier, or to anchor a time span that started or ended a short time ago\n\n### Form and templates\n- さっき + V(た/ました): an action that happened a short time ago\n- さっきの + N: “the N from a moment ago”\n- さっきから + V(ている/ています): “since a short while ago (and still continuing)”\n- さっきまで + V(ていた/でした): “until a moment ago (but finished now)”\n- Particle behavior:\n  - Usually used without に; さっきに is unnatural in most contexts\n  - Can take の to modify a noun (さっきの〜)\n  - Can take から/まで to mark a starting/ending point (さっきから／さっきまで)\n  - Can be topicalized with は for contrast (さっきは〜)\n- Position: typically sentence-initial or immediately before the predicate\n- Conjugation: さっき itself doesn’t conjugate; choose verb forms according to meaning\n  - Completed event: past (〜た／〜ました)\n  - Ongoing since earlier: 〜ている\n  - Was true until a moment ago: 〜ていた／でした\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register: common in everyday speech; neutral–casual tone\n  - More polite/formal alternative: 先ほど／先程 (business, formal talk)\n- Time scope: minutes to (roughly) within the same part of the day; not used for yesterday or earlier days\n- Semantics:\n  - Always points to the past; does not mean “soon”\n  - さっきから emphasizes continuation from a little while ago\n  - さっきまで emphasizes that something just ended\n- Orthography:\n  - さっき is usually written in hiragana\n  - Formal synonym 先ほど／先程 has kanji\n  - Intensified variants: ついさっき, いまさっき (more emphatic, casual)\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Using さっき with に (✗ さっきに…): normally omit に; use から/まで for range\n- Using present tense for a completed action after さっき; use past (〜た／〜ました)\n- Using さっき for events that were not very recent (e.g., yesterday); use きのう／この前 instead\n- Confusing さっき (a little while ago) with 先に (ahead/first/beforehand), which refers to order, not past time\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- 今: “now” (present moment), not the past\n- たった今: “just now” with a stronger sense of immediacy than さっき\n- 先ほど／先程: “a little while ago” in polite/formal contexts; slightly more detached/formal than さっき\n- この前: “the other day/recently” (usually days ago, not minutes ago)\n- 〜たばかり: “have just done”; focuses on recency of completion without naming a specific time word",
