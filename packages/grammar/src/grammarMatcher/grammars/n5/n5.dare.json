  "explanation": "### Name\n- 疑問詞「だれ」（誰）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Asks about a person’s identity or role: who, whom, whose, with whom, from whom\n\n### Form and templates\n- Core patterns\n  - 誰が V? (who is the subject/doer)\n  - 誰を V? (whom as direct object)\n  - 誰に V? / 誰から V? (to/from whom; agent in passive uses 誰に)\n  - 誰と V? (with whom)\n  - 誰の N? (whose N)\n  - N は 誰ですか? (who is this/that person; identify a person)\n  - 誰ですか? (who is it)\n- Particle requirements and ordering\n  - Interrogatives as subjects take が, not は, in questions\n  - Choose を／に／と／から according to the verb’s case pattern (dictionary usage)\n  - Possession uses の directly after 誰\n- Optional/alternative parts\n  - Polite variant: どなた; very polite: どちらさま\n  - Sentence-final question marking: ですか (polite); rising intonation in plain speech\n- Conjugation/inflection notes\n  - With copula: 誰です (polite), 誰だ (plain). Avoid mixing (×誰だです)\n  - For “whose (is it)?” the predicate can be omitted: 誰の（ですか）\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register and naturalness\n  - だれ: neutral/casual to neutral-polite\n  - どなた: polite; use with customers/superiors\n  - どちらさま: very polite/formal when asking identity (phone, reception)\n  - 誰だ? sounds blunt/rough; prefer 誰ですか in polite contexts\n- Semantic scope\n  - 誰 refers to people only. For things/choices use 何／どれ・どのN; for places use どこ\n  - Use 誰の for possession (whose), not 誰 alone\n- Particle nuances\n  - 誰へ is generally unnatural for “to whom”; use 誰に\n  - Passive “by whom” takes 誰に\n- Orthographic variants\n  - だれ (hiragana) and 誰 (kanji) are both common; beginners often see だれ\n  - どなた is usually written in kana; 何方 is rare in modern writing\n\n### Common mistakes\n- Using は after 誰 in questions (誰は…?); use が for the subject\n- Using 誰へ for “to whom”; use 誰に\n- Asking “whose” with 誰 instead of 誰の\n- Confusing 誰か／誰も／誰でも:\n  - 誰か = someone\n  - 誰も + negative = no one\n  - 誰でも = anyone/everyone (as a general possibility)\n- Mixing copulas: ×誰だですか → use 誰ですか (polite) or 誰だ？ (plain/rough)\n\n### Related grammar\n- どなた: polite “who” (substitute for 誰)\n- どちらさま: very polite “who/which person”\n- 誰か／誰も（〜ない）／誰でも: “someone” / “no one” (with negative) / “anyone”\n- 何 vs 誰: “what” (non-person) vs “who” (person)\n- どれ・どのN／どの人: “which (one/person)” for selecting among known options, not identity-shift “who”",
