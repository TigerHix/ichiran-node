  "explanation": "### Name\n- 〜けど（逆接）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Connects two clauses to show contrast or an unexpected result: but, however, although\n- In conversation, sentence-final 〜けど can trail off to soften a statement, hint at a request, or invite a response\n\n### Form and templates\n- Clause1 + けど + Clause2\n- V(plain, any tense) + けど + Clause\n- い-adj + けど + Clause\n- な-adj + だ + けど + Clause → often written as だけど\n- N + だ + けど + Clause → often written as だけど\n- Polite: Vます／N・な-adj + です + けど + Clause\n- Variants (more formal/softer): けれど／けれども\n- Very polite alternative in the same slot: 〜ですが（＝〜です＋が）\n\nNotes\n- けど attaches directly to the clause-final predicate\n- After N/な-adj in plain form, include だ before けど (spelled together as だけど)\n- After V/い-adj, use けど (not だけど)\n- Any tense/negation can appear before けど (e.g., past, negative, past-negative)\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register:\n  - けど: casual, very common in speech\n  - けれど／けれども: neutral→polite; common in polite speech and writing\n  - 〜ですが: polite; frequent in customer service/business\n- Main point usually comes after けど; the first clause sets background or contrast\n- Sentence-final 〜けど。softens or leaves the rest unsaid; fine in conversation, avoid in formal writing\n- だけど is common after N/な-adj and can also start a new sentence to contrast with prior context; sentence-initial けど is colloquial and best avoided in writing\n- Orthography: usually written in kana (けど／けれど／けれども／だけど)\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Omitting だ before けど after N/な-adj (writing Nけど／な-adjけど) instead of Nだ（=だけど）／な-adjだ（=だけど）\n- Using けど in very formal writing; prefer けれども／が／しかし\n- Trying to use でも mid-sentence like けど; でも typically starts a new sentence/utterance\n- Placing the main message before けど, making the sentence feel unfinished or weak\n- Mixing plain and polite styles across けど unintentionally; keep registers consistent\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- けれど／けれども: same meaning as けど; longer and more formal/polite\n- が（逆接の接続助詞）: “but” inside a sentence; more formal/stiff than けど; common with です／ます as ですが\n- でも: sentence-initial “but/however”; looser link than けど\n- のに: “even though/despite”; stronger contradiction, often with frustration; generally not used to make requests/suggestions\n- しかし: sentence-initial “however” in formal writing, not used to directly attach to predicates",
