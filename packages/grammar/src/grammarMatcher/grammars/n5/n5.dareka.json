  "explanation": "### Name\n- 誰か（不特定の人）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Indicates an unknown or unspecified person: someone/somebody. Used to talk about actions done by someone, things done to someone, or something that belongs to someone. In questions it asks about the existence of such a person (yes/no), not the identity.\n\n### Form and templates\n- Core\n  - 誰かが V: someone is/does …\n  - 誰かを V: do … to someone; look for/call someone, etc.\n  - 誰かに V: say/give/ask to someone; be affected by someone\n  - 誰かと V: do … with someone\n  - 誰かから V: receive/hear/learn from someone\n  - 誰かの N: someone’s N\n\n- Particles and ordering\n  - 誰か behaves like a noun/pronoun; attach the needed case particle directly after it (が, を, に, と, から, の, など).\n  - As a new/indefinite subject, が is strongly preferred. は after 誰か is limited to contrastive/topic uses.\n  - With existence verbs, use いる (for people), not ある.\n\n- Optional/alternative forms\n  - Polite/honorific: どなたか (in place of 誰か) in formal or respectful contexts.\n  - Plural-like meaning: 誰か usually implies “one person” but can be plural by context; for “some people (several),” prefer 何人か.\n\n- Conjugation/inflection\n  - 誰か itself does not conjugate. Verbs and adjectives around it conjugate normally (polite/plain, past, negative, progressive, etc.).\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register and naturalness\n  - 誰か is neutral and common in speech and writing.\n  - Use どなたか in polite questions/announcements or when showing respect.\n  - In casual speech, some particles may be dropped when obvious, but keep them in careful or learner writing.\n\n- Semantic scope\n  - Refers to an unspecified person; identity is unknown or irrelevant.\n  - In questions with 誰か, you are asking “Is there anyone who…?” (existence), not “Who…?” (identity).\n\n- Orthographic variants\n  - だれか (kana) and 誰か (kanji) are both common. Beginner materials often use kana; general writing often uses 誰か.\n  - どなたか is usually written in kana; 何方か is rare/old-fashioned.\n\n### Common mistakes\n- Using は after 誰か for a new subject; use が unless contrasting.\n- Trying to say “no one” with 誰か＋negative; use 誰も〜ない instead.\n- Using ある with people; use いる for human existence.\n- Using 誰かたち for “some people”; use 何人か.\n- Using 誰か in place of どなたか in formal situations.\n\n### Related grammar\n- 誰: “who” (asks for identity). 誰か asks about existence of an unspecified person instead.\n- 誰も〜ない: “no one/nobody” (requires a negative predicate).\n- 誰でも: “anyone/whoever” (generalization/permission/possibility).\n- どなた／どなたか: polite “who”/“someone.”\n- 何か／どこか／いつか: “something/somewhere/sometime” (same indefiniteness pattern with 〜か).",
