  "explanation": "### Name\n- なんで（理由をたずねる）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Asks for the reason or cause of an action/situation: “why?” / “how come?”\n- Often carries a tone of surprise, doubt, or mild complaint in casual speech\n\n### Form and templates\n- なんで + V(plain) + (の？ / んですか？)\n- なんで + い-adj(plain) + (の？ / んですか？)\n- なんで + N / な-adj + (なの？ / なんですか？)\n- Elliptical/short forms: なんで？ / なんでだ？ / なんでですか？\n- Particle behavior: なんで is an interrogative adverb; no particle attaches to it. Place it at the start of the clause (most common) or before the predicate.\n- Politeness/softening: adding の？ (casual) or んですか？ (polite, explanatory) makes the question softer and more natural.\n- Conjugation: なんで itself does not conjugate; tense/negation/politeness appear on the predicate as usual.\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register:\n  - Very common in casual conversation.\n  - Sounds blunt/accusatory if used directly, especially without の/んです.\n  - Avoid in formal settings or toward superiors; prefer どうして or なぜ.\n- Nuance:\n  - “How come” flavor; can imply criticism or disbelief depending on tone.\n  - の／んです softens and invites an explanation; without it can sound demanding.\n- Politeness pairing:\n  - なんでですか is widely heard in everyday speech but still casual in feel.\n  - For clearly polite/formal questions, prefer どうしてですか or なぜですか.\n- Orthography and ambiguity:\n  - なんで “why” is usually written in hiragana to avoid confusion.\n  - 何で can be read as なにで (“with what/by what means”). Be careful: 何で + V(ます/plain) can mean “by what means,” not “why.”\n- Scope:\n  - Asks for the reason for the clause it precedes. Works with any tense or polarity of the predicate.\n\n### Common mistakes\n- Writing 何で to mean “why” in contexts where it could be read as なにで (“with what/by what means”).\n- Using なんで with superiors or in formal writing/speeches; choose どうして or なぜ instead.\n- Saying なんで + V/い-adj + ですか (missing ん): for polite questions with verbs/い-adjectives, use んですか.\n- Misinterpreting 何で + 行きますか as “why go”; it means “by what means go.”\n\n### Related grammar\n- どうして: Neutral “why”; safe in both casual and polite contexts; most common teaching form.\n- なぜ: More formal/literary “why”; common in writing, announcements, or careful speech.\n- 何で（なにで）: “With what / by what means” (instrument/method), not “why.”\n- どうやって: “How/by what method,” not “why.”\n- 〜から／〜ので: Give a reason (“because”); used to answer questions with なんで／どうして／なぜ.",
