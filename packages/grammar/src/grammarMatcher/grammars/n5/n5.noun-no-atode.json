  "explanation": "### Name\n- 名詞＋のあとで／のあとに\n\n### Meaning and function\n- States that one event/action happens after a noun-referent event or time; “after N,” “later than N (in sequence).”\n\n### Form and templates\n- N の あとで + clause\n- N の あとに + clause\n- N の あと + clause (particle omitted in casual speech; treats あと as a time noun)\n- あとで + clause (no N; “later,” used when the reference is clear)\n\nNotes on particles and ordering:\n- で is the most common in conversation; に marks the point in time more neutrally/formally. Meaning difference is small at this level.\n- The whole time phrase can take topic/contrast particles: N の あと(で/に) は／も + clause.\n- As a noun phrase, あと can combine with other particles: N の あとから／まで, etc.\n\nWhat counts as N:\n- Event/activity nouns (e.g., lessons, meals, work, parties) and time nouns (today, this week, vacation).\n- Not used with concrete objects or places to mean “behind” (that’s うしろ), and not directly with verbs; with verbs use V-たあとで (see Related).\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register: Natural in both plain and polite speech. に is a little more formal/written; で is very common in everyday conversation.\n- Semantic scope: Indicates temporal sequence (Event/Time N finishes or passes → next action happens). It does not express physical position.\n- With specific clock times/dates or durations:\n  - Durations are often expressed with X後 (e.g., “X hours later”) rather than N の あとで.\n  - For specific times/dates, N の あと(で/に) is acceptable; formal/written alternatives include 以後／以降.\n- Pronouns/demonstratives can substitute for N (e.g., “after that/this”), commonly forming そのあと／このあと.\n- Orthography:\n  - あと vs 後: both common. Kana is frequent in textbooks; 後 is standard in general writing.\n  - のちに (後に) is a more formal/literary alternative to あとに; avoid at N5 unless reading.\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Omitting の after a noun (N あとで … is incorrect; use N の あとで …).\n- Using non-event nouns (objects/people) as N when the meaning is temporal.\n- Confusing “after” (あと) with “behind” (うしろ).\n- For verbs, using dictionary form before あとで (should be V-たあとで, not V-るあとで).\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- V-たあとで／V-たあとに: “after doing V.” Verb-based counterpart; required when N is an action expressed by a verb.\n- N の まえに: “before N.” Antonym expressing prior sequence.\n- V-てから: “after doing V, then …”; emphasizes the next action starting only after the first completes; very common in spoken sequence.\n- X後／X以後／X以降: “X later/since X (time).” More concise/formal with times/durations; 以降/以後 are formal and often written.",
