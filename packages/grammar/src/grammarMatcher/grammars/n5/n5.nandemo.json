  "explanation": "### Name\n- 疑問詞＋でも（自由選択）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Expresses free choice: “any ~ / whoever / whatever / wherever / whenever / as much as you like.” The idea is “no matter which/when/who,” the result holds.\n\n### Form and templates\n- Core: 疑問詞 + でも + Predicate\n  - が/を are typically dropped with でも.\n  - Other case particles come before でも.\n- With case particles (keep the particle before でも):\n  - 誰にでも, 誰とでも\n  - どこへでも／どこにでも, どこからでも, どこででも\n  - いつからでも, いつまででも\n- Common sets\n  - 誰でも = anyone\n  - 何でも = anything\n  - いつでも = anytime\n  - どこでも = anywhere\n  - どれでも = whichever (one among several)\n  - どちらでも／どっちでも = either/whichever (of two; どちら is politer)\n  - どのNでも = any N\n  - どんなNでも = any kind of N\n  - いくらでも = as much/many as you like\n  - いくつでも = any number; as many (countable) as you like\n  - どれくらいでも／どのくらいでも = any degree/amount\n- Position and role\n  - Functions as subject/object/adverbial depending on the interrogative (e.g., 誰でも as subject-like, 何でも as object-like, どこでも/いつでも as adverbials).\n  - When modifying a noun, use どのNでも or どんなNでも (not どれでもN).\n- Politeness/conjugation\n  - Combine with any predicate form (plain/polite, non-past/past, potential, volitional, imperative, etc.). No special conjugation on でも itself.\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Affirmative orientation: Typically used with affirmative, potential, requests, offers, permissions, and general truths. It does not create “none/no one/nothing” readings; that role is done by 疑問詞＋も＋否定.\n- Case marking\n  - が／を are usually omitted: 誰でも…, 何でも….\n  - Keep other case particles before でも: 誰にでも, どこへでも, いつからでも, etc.\n  - For locations of action, both どこでも and どこででも occur; どこでも often suffices, どこででも can add emphasis on “at any place.”\n- Choice sets\n  - どれでも is for selecting one among three or more. For two options, prefer どちらでも (polite) / どっちでも (casual).\n  - To modify a noun: どのNでも (any specific item) vs どんなNでも (any kind/type).\n- いつでも vs いつも\n  - いつでも = “anytime/whenever you choose” (availability/free choice).\n  - いつも = “always/usually” (habit/frequency).\n- Scope/semantics\n  - Conveys freedom of choice granted by the situation/speaker (e.g., “whichever is fine,” “can V anywhere”).\n- Not a question form\n  - 疑問詞＋でも is used in statements/commands/permissions, not to form questions.\n- Orthography\n  - 何でも／なんでも (both common; kana is frequent in casual text).\n  - 誰でも／だれでも, 何でも／なんでも, 何にでも／なんにでも, etc. Both kanji and kana are acceptable; kana skews more casual/readable.\n- Distinguish from other でも\n  - N＋でも can mean “even N” (concessive) or “N or something / how about N?” (suggestion). Those are different patterns from 疑問詞＋でも.\n\n### Common mistakes\n- Using 疑問詞＋でも with a negative to mean “none/no one/nothing.” Correct pattern is 疑問詞＋も＋否定.\n- Placing the case particle after でも (e.g., 誰でもに). The case particle must come before でも (誰にでも).\n- Adding が／を after でも (e.g., 誰でもが). が／を are normally omitted with でも-phrases.\n- Using どれでも when there are only two choices. Use どちらでも／どっちでも.\n- Trying to attach でも directly to a noun with どれ (e.g., どれでもN). For noun modification, use どのNでも or どんなNでも.\n\n### Related grammar\n- 疑問詞＋も\n  - With negative: “none/no one/nothing/nowhere.” With certain items in affirmative (いつも, どこも, どれも) can mean “always/everywhere/all.”\n- N＋でも (提案／列挙)\n  - “N or something; how about N?” Different use from free-choice 疑問詞＋でも.\n- 〜ても\n  - “Even if; no matter (how).” Clause-level concessive, not a free-choice interrogative.\n- 疑問詞＋か\n  - “Some ~ / someone / somewhere / sometime” (indefinite, not free-choice).\n- どちら／どっち\n  - Two-choice interrogatives; with でも they become “either/whichever (of two).”",
