  "explanation": "### Name\n- 場所に来る（Nに来ます）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Expresses movement toward and arrival at a place; “to come to N,” typically toward where the speaker or listener is or a shared “here.”\n\n### Form and templates\n- Core\n  - N(place) に 来る / 来ます\n- Alternatives\n  - N(place) へ 来る / 来ます（directional; に is more common with 来る and emphasizes arrival）\n- Negation and past (irregular verb)\n  - N に 来ない / 来ません\n  - N に 来た / 来ました\n- Other notes\n  - に can take は for contrast/emphasis: N には 来ません\n  - Typical ordering when adding time: [Time] に + [Place] に + 来ます\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register\n  - Neutral and very common. Use 〜ます in polite contexts.\n  - Honorific/humble alternatives exist in formal settings (e.g., いらっしゃる / お越しになる; 参ります).\n- Semantic scope\n  - Use 来る when the destination is “here” relative to the speaker or listener (e.g., the speaker’s current location, the listener’s place, or a mutually recognized “here”).\n  - Use 行く instead when the movement is away from the speaker/listener (i.e., not toward “here”).\n  - The destination should be a place/event location. If referring to a person, specify their place (e.g., Xさんの家/ところ).\n- Particle behavior\n  - に marks destination/arrival. へ marks direction (weaker arrival focus); with 来る, に is generally more natural.\n  - Do not use で for destination; で marks the location where an action occurs.\n  - に also marks time; with a time noun it means “at [time],” not a destination.\n- Orthography and readings\n  - 来る（くる）, 来ます（きます）, 来ない（こない）, 来た（きた）, 来て（きて）.\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Using で instead of に to mark the destination.\n- Using 来る when the movement is not toward “here” (should be 行く).\n- Marking a person directly as destination (友だちに来ます); specify the place related to the person instead.\n- Assuming へ is equally natural with 来る in all cases; prefer に with 来る at this level.\n- Double particles like へに or にへ.\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- Nに行きます: go to a place (movement away from “here”); contrasts with 来る’s “toward here.”\n- Nへ行きます / Nへ来ます: uses へ for direction; weaker sense of arrival than に.\n- Nに帰ります: return/go back to a home base.\n- V(stem) に 来る: come in order to do something (purpose に), distinct from destination に.",
