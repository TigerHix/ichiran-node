  "explanation": "### Name\n- 指示語「そちら」\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Polite demonstrative that points to the listener’s side:\n  - Direction/place near the listener: “that way,” “there (by you)”\n  - The listener/the listener’s side (person, group, company): “you/your side,” “that person (near you)” in a polite, indirect way\n\n### Form and templates\n- そちら (acts as a noun/pronoun)\n- そちら + particle\n  - Topic/subject/etc.: は, が, を, も\n  - Place/direction: に, へ\n  - Location of action: で\n  - From/to: から, まで\n  - Comparison/quoting: と, より\n- そちらの + N\n  - “your N / that N (on your side)”\n- Very polite/person-referring variants:\n  - そちら様 (very polite “you/that person”)\n  - そちらの方 (polite “that person on your side”)\n- No conjugation; behaves like a noun. Use の to modify another noun.\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register: Polite-neutral. Common in customer service, phone calls, and business. More polite than そっち and softer/more indirect than そこ/それ in many contexts.\n- Distance/deixis:\n  - そちら = near the listener\n  - こちら = near the speaker\n  - あちら = far from both\n- Person reference:\n  - Can politely refer to the listener (“your side”) or a person near the listener. Prefer names/titles when known; そちら can feel distant if used face-to-face.\n- Scope:\n  - Can refer to places, directions, people, or organizations related to the listener (e.g., “your company/home/area”).\n- Particle use:\n  - Use に/へ for destination or direction, で for place of action, から/まで for range. It is not an adverb; attach the appropriate particle.\n- Orthography:\n  - Standard: そちら (hiragana). Kanji 其方 is archaic/literary.\n  - Casual counterpart: そっち (informal speech).\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Confusing distance: using そちら when the referent is far from both sides (should be あちら), or near the speaker (should be こちら).\n- Using そっち in formal or polite situations.\n- Omitting particles when using it for place/direction (must use に/へ/で, etc.).\n- Using そちら to ask “who” (use どちら/どなた; そちら is not an interrogative).\n- Overusing そちらの方 for people; can sound roundabout or awkward—use names/titles when possible.\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- こちら: “this way/here; I/we (humble),” speaker’s side; polite.\n- あちら: “that way over there; he/she/they (polite),” far from both.\n- どちら: “which way/which one/where; who (polite).”\n- そこ／それ／その: less polite “there/that/that + N” near the listener; そちら is the more polite/directional/person-friendly counterpart.\n- そっち: casual version of そちら.",
