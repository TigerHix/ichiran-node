  "explanation": "### Name\n- 頻度副詞「たいてい」\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Expresses “usually,” “mostly,” or “generally” — the normal or typical case, a high-frequency habit, or what generally holds true\n\n### Form and templates\n- たいてい + S (clause-level adverb; position is usually sentence-initial or just before the predicate)\n- たいていは + S (adds topic/contrast emphasis: “as for most cases, …”)\n- たいていの + N (“most N; almost all N”)\n\nNotes\n- No conjugation. It modifies the whole clause, or, with の, modifies a noun.\n- Works with plain or polite predicates. Negation applies to the predicate: たいてい〜ない = “usually don’t …”\n- Particle behavior:\n  - は may follow たいてい to topicalize/contrast (たいていは).\n  - の is required when directly modifying a noun (たいていのN).\n- Placement: commonly at the start of the sentence or before the main predicate; with の it precedes the noun.\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register: Neutral and common in everyday speech and writing. Natural in both plain and polite styles.\n- Semantics/scope: Describes the usual pattern or default tendency. It scopes over the entire proposition, not just a single word.\n- Not for approximation of amounts or time. Use だいたい/約 for “about/approximately.”\n- たいていの + N means “most N,” but it highlights typicality rather than precise quantity.\n- Orthography:\n  - Kana: たいてい (very common and recommended for learners)\n  - Kanji: 大抵 (more formal/printed style; be careful not to confuse with 大体 = だいたい)\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Confusing 大抵(たいてい “usually”) with 大体(だいたい “approximately/roughly”).\n- Saying たいていです as a standalone predicate in the “usually” sense. Use it to modify a clause, or use たいていの + N.\n- Using たいてい to approximate numbers or amounts (use だいたい/約 instead).\n- Redundantly stacking frequency adverbs (e.g., combining with いつも in the same slot), which sounds heavy or unnatural.\n- Using たいていに + V to mean “usually” (に-form belongs to a different idiom meaning “enough/already,” not N5 usage).\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- いつも: “always” (near 100%); stronger than たいてい.\n- よく: “often/frequently” (lower frequency than たいてい; event happens many times, not necessarily the default case).\n- ふだん(は): “usually/ordinarily” with a focus on the usual state/time frame rather than frequency counts.\n- だいたい: “about/approximately; generally.” Overlaps in “generally,” but is the normal choice for approximations and rough amounts.\n- ほとんど: “almost all/most; nearly.” With negatives, “hardly (ever/any).” Stronger in coverage than たいてい and common with 〜ない.",
