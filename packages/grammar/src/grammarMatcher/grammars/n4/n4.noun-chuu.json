  "explanation": "### Name\n- 〜中（ちゅう）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- States that an activity or period is ongoing: during, in the middle of, in progress, occupied/in use\n\n### Form and templates\n- N(activity/event/period) + 中\n- N + 中に … (something happens at some point during/within that period; often carries a “by the end of” nuance with time periods)\n- N + 中は … (topic/contrast: throughout that period, …)\n- N + 中の + N2 (N2 that occurs/takes place during N)\n- Predicate use: N + 中だ／です；past: 中だった／でした\n- No particle between N and 中. Adding の before 中 changes the meaning to “inside/among” (Nの中).\n- Reading:\n  - ちゅう when it means “during/in progress” (this grammar).\n  - じゅう is a different pattern meaning “throughout/all” (e.g., time/space coverage), not the same usage.\n- N must denote an activity (often a する-noun: meetings, calls, study, work), an event, or a bounded time period (morning, the period, the break, this week/month, etc.). Not used with place nouns to mean “inside” (use Nの中).\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register: neutral and common in speech; very frequent on signs/announcements (concise labels like “in use/occupied”).\n- Semantics:\n  - Focuses on an ongoing action/state or a bounded period currently in effect.\n  - With time expressions + 中に, often means “within/by the end of that period.”\n  - For a stronger “right in the middle (just then)” emphasis, see 最中.\n- Scope/position:\n  - Bare N中 can stand alone as a label or function adverbially.\n  - N中に highlights when another event occurs; N中は sets the temporal topic.\n- Orthography/reading:\n  - Use kanji 中; read ちゅう in this meaning.\n  - Do not read as なか (that’s “inside/among” with の: Nの中).\n  - Distinguish from 中（じゅう） “throughout/all” with certain time/space nouns (a separate pattern).\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Inserting の between N and 中 (→ changes meaning to “inside N”).\n- Attaching 中 to a verb directly; use a noun (often a する-noun). For verb actions with “right in the middle,” use 最中.\n- Misreading as なか or confusing with 中（じゅう） “throughout.”\n- Using 中 with nouns that don’t denote an activity or bounded period.\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- 〜最中（さいちゅう）: “right in the middle (of doing),” stronger immediacy; V-ている／Nの + 最中.\n- 〜間／〜間に: “while/during” (continuous scope) vs “at some point during.”\n- 〜中（じゅう）: “throughout/all” a time span or space (e.g., all day/all over); different reading/nuance.\n- 〜うちに: “within/before (a change happens),” goal-oriented timing.\n- 〜ところだ: “be about to/just/now doing,” point-in-time aspect.",
