  "explanation": "### Name\n- 助詞「に」（方向・目的・時点）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Marks the goal/endpoint of movement (to; into; onto) and direction (toward).\n- Marks the purpose of movement with verbs like go/come/return (in order to).\n- Marks a specific point in time when something happens (at/on/in).\n\n### Form and templates\n- Destination/goal\n  - Place N + に + [motion/arrival verb: 行く・来る・帰る・着く・入る など]\n  - Direction word (右・左・前・後ろ・北・南 など) + に + [movement/turn verb]\n  - Alternative for pure direction only: Place N + へ + [motion verb] (に emphasizes arrival/goal; へ emphasizes direction)\n- Purpose of movement\n  - N(suru) + (し) に + [行く・来る・帰る・出かける・戻る など]\n  - Alternative (very common): V(stem) + に + [movement verb]\n  - Restriction: only with verbs of movement/direction\n- Time point\n  - N(time: specific clock time, day, date, month, year, holiday, weekend) + に + [predicate]\n  - Optionality: with days of the week/dates/months, に may be omitted in casual speech; with exact clock times it’s normally used\n  - Do not use に with relative-time words (今日・明日・昨日・今・来週・毎日 など), except for special contrastive/emphatic patterns\n- Ordering and co-occurrence\n  - Time N + に and Place N + に can co-occur in one clause; time generally precedes place (Time に → Place に → verb)\n- Conjugation\n  - Verbs conjugate as usual (plain/polite, tense, polarity). The particle に itself does not change.\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register/naturalness: Neutral and ubiquitous in all registers; extremely frequent.\n- に vs へ (direction): に highlights the arrival/goal or endpoint; へ highlights general direction/path. へ cannot mark time or purpose.\n- に vs で (place): に marks destination/arrival or time; で marks the location where an action occurs. Do not use で for destinations or time points.\n- Purpose use:\n  - Best with V(stem) + に or with suru-nouns plus しに. Not every bare noun works naturally as a “purpose.”\n  - For general purpose not tied to movement, use ために or ように instead of に.\n- Time use:\n  - Use に with specific, countable points on the calendar/clock (3時、月曜日、4月、3日 など).\n  - Often omit に after broader periods (朝・昼・夜・週末) in everyday speech unless you want to stress the timing; adding に sounds more formal or deliberate.\n  - に marks a point-in-time, not a duration. For “for X time,” use ～間.\n  - Ambiguous forms like 三日 can mean “the 3rd (day of month)” or “three days (duration)”; adding に disambiguates it as a date/point-in-time.\n- Multiple に in one sentence is fine as each に attaches to its own noun (e.g., time に + place に).\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Using で instead of に for destinations or time points.\n- Adding に to relative-time words (今日・明日・毎日 など) where it is normally not used.\n- Using へ for purpose or time (へ cannot express these).\n- Using Nに + movement verb for purpose with a noun that is not an action; prefer V(stem) に or suru-noun + しに.\n- Using に to mark durations (三時間に勉強する × for “study for three hours”); use ～間 instead.\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- へ: Direction/path only; weaker sense of “to/toward” than に; cannot mark time or purpose.\n- で: Location of action; contrasts with に which marks destination/arrival or time.\n- ために: General “in order to/for the sake of”; usable without movement; broader than purpose に.\n- ように: Purpose/aim for achieving a state or ability; often with potential/imperative nuances; not restricted to movement.\n- まで／までに／から: Time and place boundaries (“until/as far as,” “by,” “from”); combine with に for “by [time]” (までに).",
