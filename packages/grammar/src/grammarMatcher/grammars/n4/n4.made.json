  "explanation": "### Name\n- まで（範囲・終点・意外な包含）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Marks an upper limit or end point: up to, as far as, until\n- Emphasizes unexpected inclusion: even\n\n### Form and templates\n- N + まで\n  - End point in time, place, quantity, price, etc. (inclusive of the limit)\n  - Can pair with から for ranges: N1 から N2 まで\n  - Interrogatives commonly used: いつ／どこ／いくら／何時／何円 + まで\n- Clause + まで\n  - V(plain non-past) + まで: until the action/event happens (the main clause holds up to that point)\n  - Typical endpoint verbs or change-of-state verbs fit naturally\n- Adjective-based change + まで\n  - い-adj(く)なる／な-adj(に)なる + まで: until it becomes Adj\n- “Even” (unexpected inclusion)\n  - N + まで: even N\n  - N + case particle + まで: keeps the original case while adding “even” (common with に, から, で). Use when you need both the grammatical role and the “even” nuance\n  - With simple destinations, まで typically replaces に／へ (にまで is for “even to …”, not a neutral destination)\n- Variants with focus particles\n  - X + までは: up to X (contrastive limit); often used with a negative to mean “not until X”\n  - X + までも: even X (stronger/emphatic; more written/formal)\n- Attributive\n  - X + までの + N: “the N up to X,” “N until X”\n- Particle behavior and ordering\n  - まで normally follows the element it limits and can replace some case particles (e.g., destination に／へ)\n  - When preserving the original case is needed for meaning (recipient, source, location, etc.), stack: N + case particle + まで\n- Conjugation notes\n  - In Clause + まで, the clause before まで is in plain non-past; the main clause can be plain or polite, and in any tense as needed\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register and frequency\n  - Neutral and common in speech and writing across politeness levels\n- Semantics and scope\n  - まで includes the end point\n  - With time, まで implies the action/state continues right up to that time\n  - Clause + まで selects an event/change that can serve as a clear endpoint; for ongoing states “during/while,” use 間/間に instead\n  - から and まで can appear alone if the other boundary is obvious from context, but the pair から〜まで explicitly marks both ends\n- “Even” nuance\n  - N + まで conveys speaker’s surprise or the extremity of inclusion; avoid overuse in neutral listing\n  - Case stacking (Nにまで, Nからまで, Nでまで) strengthens “even” while preserving grammatical role; を + まで is generally avoided\n- Destination vs “even to”\n  - Use 場所 + まで for a normal destination limit; にまで suggests “even to [that place/person]” (unexpected reach)\n- Contrast with までに (deadline)\n  - まで: continuity until the endpoint\n  - までに: “by (the deadline)” — occurrence at or before the time, no implication of continuous action up to it\n- Orthography\n  - Write まで in hiragana in general use; the kanji 迄 exists but is less common and feels formal/signage-like\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Confusing まで with までに; using まで when you mean a deadline (use までに for “by”)\n- Using V-て + まで to mean “until …” (for “until,” use V(plain non-past) + まで; V-てまで is a different pattern meaning “to the extent of even doing …” with a negative nuance)\n- Attaching まで directly to adjectives without なる; use い-adj(く)なる／な-adj(に)なる + まで for “until it becomes …”\n- Using にまで for a simple destination; use まで alone unless you mean “even to …”\n- Trying to use を + まで; object を generally does not combine with まで\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- までに: by (deadline); no continuous action implied\n- から〜まで: from … to …; explicitly marks both ends of a range\n- までは: up to … (contrastive); often with negatives for “not until …”\n- V-てから: after doing …; contrasts with V(plain) + まで “until …”\n- 間／間に: during/while; focuses on the span rather than the endpoint\n- くらい／ぐらい・ほど: degree/extent; similar “extent” meaning, but not an endpoint marker like まで",
