  "explanation": "### Name\n- 〜ばかり\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Limits or concentrates something: only; nothing but; full of\n- Repetitive/habitual action to the exclusion of other things: always do nothing but ~\n- Very recent completion: have just done ~\n\n### Form and templates\n- Limiting “only/nothing but” with nouns\n  - N + ばかり\n  - Predicate: N + ばかりだ/です\n  - Can take case/topic particles after it when needed: N + ばかり + を/が/に/で/は …\n  - Modifier use is possible: N + ばかりの + N (full of N)\n- “Always do nothing but” with verbs\n  - V-て + ばかりいる/います/いた\n  - Negative contrast: V-て + ばかりはいない (not doing only ~)\n  - Note: Do not use dictionary form here; use the て-form\n- “Just did” with verbs\n  - V-た + ばかり (だ/です/だった/でした)\n  - Conveys recent completion relative to the speaker’s sense of time\n- With adjectives (expressing “only X (and nothing else)” often with a negative/critical nuance)\n  - い-adj + ばかり + だ/です or で …\n  - な-adj + な + ばかり + だ/です or で …\n  - Typical as “〜ばかりで …” or “〜ばかりだ …”; rare/naturalness drops if left bare\n- Colloquial variants\n  - ばっかり (casual), ばっか (very casual). Use ばかり in neutral/formal contexts.\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register and tone\n  - Neutral in “N + ばかり” and “V-た + ばかり”; ばっかり/ばっか is casual speech.\n  - “V-てばかりいる” often carries a complaining/critical tone (“does nothing but ~”).\n- Nuance of limitation\n  - ばかり often suggests excess/monotony (“too much of one thing”), not a mathematically strict “only.” For strict/neutral “only,” だけ is safer.\n- Scope and placement\n  - Attach ばかり directly to the element you want to limit; moving it changes the scope/meaning.\n- “Just did” timing\n  - V-たばかり is subjective “recently” (can be minutes, hours, sometimes even days). For “just now” in an objective, instantaneous sense, compare with V-たところ (see Related).\n- Orthography\n  - Usually written in kana: ばかり. Colloquial: ばっかり/ばっか. ばかし is dialectal/old-fashioned.\n- Not covered here\n  - The “approximately/about” sense of ばかり (with numbers/amounts) is a different usage and is not the target of this N4 item.\n\n### Common mistakes\n- Using V(dictionary) + ばかり to mean “always ~”: use V-て + ばかりいる.\n- Using V-たばかり for events that are no longer “recent” (e.g., long ago); it sounds unnatural.\n- Attaching だ before ばかり with な-adjectives when connecting: prefer な + ばかり (〜なばかりで …). Use 〜ばかりだ/です to end the sentence.\n- Overusing ばっかり/ばっか in polite or formal contexts.\n- Treating ばかり as the same as だけ; ばかり often implies excess/complaint.\n\n### Related grammar\n- だけ: Neutral “only” without the “excess/monotony” nuance. Cannot mean “just did.”\n- しか〜ない: “Nothing but/only” with ない; stronger restriction than だけ; cannot express “just did.”\n- V-たところ(だ): “Just did (now)” in a more objective/immediate sense; たばかり is broader/subjective “recently.”\n- 〜だけで: “With only/just ~; by ~ alone.” vs 〜ばかりで often implies “nothing but ~ (and …)” with a negative/critical continuation.",
