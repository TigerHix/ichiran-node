  "explanation": "### Name\n- Nをくださる（くれるの尊敬語）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Indicates that someone (whom the speaker respects) gives something to the speaker or the speaker’s in-group, implying a favor/benefit to the receiver.\n\n### Form and templates\n- Core\n  - X が [Recipient に] N を くださる\n- Polite forms\n  - くださいます（non-past polite）\n  - くださいました（past polite）\n- Plain forms\n  - くださる（non-past）\n  - くださった（past）\n  - くださらない（negative）\n  - くださって（te-form）\n- Particles and ordering\n  - Giver: が/は\n  - Recipient (usually the speaker or in-group): に（often omitted if obvious）\n  - Thing given: を\n- Alternatives\n  - When the “thing” is an action, use V-てくださる (do V for me as a favor). This is the action-benefactive counterpart of N を くださる.\n- Conjugation note\n  - くださる is the honorific counterpart of くれる and conjugates irregularly in polite form: くださいます, くださいました (not くださるます).\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register and naturalness\n  - Honorific/respectful toward the giver; common in polite speech, business, and formal writing.\n  - In casual settings with equals/intimates, くれる is more natural.\n- Directionality/benefit\n  - Used only when the recipient is the speaker or someone in the speaker’s in-group. Do not use it for giving that does not benefit the speaker’s side; use あげる/さしあげる instead.\n- Subject marking\n  - The giver is the grammatical subject (が/は). Do not mark the giver with に or から in this pattern.\n- Recipient marking\n  - The recipient (often 私/家族/会社, etc.) can be marked with に; it is often omitted when the recipient is the speaker and is clear from context.\n- Orthography\n  - Verb: 下さる／くださる are both seen; many style guides prefer 下さる for the honorific verb.\n  - Request ください (as in “N を ください” or “V-てください”) is a different item and is usually written in hiragana; do not confuse it with the verb くださる.\n- Scope\n  - Typically takes human (or organization) givers. Using it for non-human “givers” is unusual.\n- Honorific alignment\n  - Because it honors the giver, do not use it with yourself as the subject.\n\n### Common mistakes\n- Using ください (request) instead of くださる (descriptive “give to me/us”).\n- Marking the giver with に/から; with くださる the giver is the subject (が/は).\n- Using くださる when the recipient is outside the speaker’s in-group (should use あげる/さしあげる).\n- Overusing くださる in casual talk where くれる is expected, making the sentence sound overly formal or stiff.\n\n### Related grammar\n- N を くれる: Neutral, non-honorific counterpart; still “give to me/us,” used with equals/intimates.\n- V-てくださる: Action-benefactive (“kindly do V for me/us”); same honorific stance toward the doer.\n- N を ください: Request (“please give me N”); imperative/polite request, not a descriptive benefactive.\n- N を いただく: Humble “receive” from someone respected; focuses on the receiver (speaker) rather than honoring the giver.\n- N を あげる／さしあげる: “Give (to someone else)”; opposite direction; さしあげる is the humble/polite counterpart.",
