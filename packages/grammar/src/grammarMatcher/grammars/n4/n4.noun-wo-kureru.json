  "explanation": "### Name\n- くれる（相手→自分側に与える）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- States that someone gives something to the speaker or to someone in the speaker’s in-group (family, close colleagues, etc.). The viewpoint is the receiver’s side (benefit to “me/us”).\n\n### Form and templates\n- Giver が Receiver に N を くれる\n- Polite: くれます\n- Past: くれた／くれました\n- Negative: くれない／くれません\n- Topic marking:\n  - Giver は … Receiver に N を くれる (giver as topic/contrast)\n  - Receiver には … N を くれる (receiver as topic/contrast)\n- Omission:\n  - Receiver に (often omitted when it is the speaker; default reading is “to me”)\n  - Giver が/は (often omitted if clear from context)\n- Honorific alternate (respectful to the giver): くださる／くださいます\n- Particles:\n  - Subject: が (or は as topic)\n  - Receiver: に (へ is not used here)\n  - Object: を\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register:\n  - Neutral/plain: くれる\n  - Polite: くれます\n  - Honorific (giver is higher status): くださる／くださいます\n- Receiver restriction:\n  - Use only when the receiver is the speaker or someone close/in-group to the speaker. For neutral third-to-third giving, use あげる instead.\n- Perspective:\n  - Emphasizes benefit to the speaker/in-group. If you want the receiver to be the subject, use もらう instead.\n- Requests:\n  - To ask the listener to give you something, use ください (N を ください) or a request with くれますか／くれる？ rather than a bare declarative.\n- Particle behavior:\n  - に marks the receiver. が marks the giver (or は for topic). を marks the item given.\n- Orthography:\n  - くれる is usually written in kana. The kanji 呉れる appears in dictionaries/literary contexts.\n  - The honorific verb is 下さる; the request form is typically written ください (kana) in modern usage.\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Using くれる when the receiver is not the speaker/in-group; use あげる for third-to-third giving.\n- Marking the receiver with は or を instead of に in the core pattern.\n- Marking the giver with に (confusing with もらう’s pattern using に／から).\n- Saying X が N を ください as a statement; ください is for requests. Use X が Y に N を くれる (or the honorific くださる) to describe giving.\n- Using くれる with the speaker as the giver; if the speaker gives to someone else, use あげる.\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- あげる: Giver-oriented “give” from the speaker/in-group to others (or between third parties from the giver’s viewpoint).\n- もらう: Receiver-oriented “receive”; the receiver is the grammatical subject.\n- くださる／ください: Honorific of くれる; ください is the polite request form to ask the listener to give.\n- Vてくれる: Benefactive action “do something for me/us” (giver performs an action benefiting the speaker/in-group).",
