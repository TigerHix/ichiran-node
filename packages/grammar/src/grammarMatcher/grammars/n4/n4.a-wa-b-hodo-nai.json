  "explanation": "### Name\n- AはBほど〜ない（劣等比較）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Says that A does not reach B’s level in degree, amount, frequency, or ability; “A is not as … as B.”\n\n### Form and templates\n- A は B ほど い-adj(〜く) ない\n- A は B ほど な-adj(〜では) ない\n  - Casual: な-adj(〜じゃない)\n- A は B ほど V(ない)\n  - Polite negatives: い-adj(〜くありません), な-adj(〜ではありません), V(ません)\n- Optional focus/contrast:\n  - B ほどは … ない (adds a contrastive, “not as … at least” nuance)\n- Conjugation notes\n  - Past negative is possible when talking about the past: い-adj(〜くなかった), な-adj(〜ではなかった), V(なかった)\n  - Verbs are in the plain negative (〜ない). Use a potential verb only if you specifically mean ability (the pattern itself is not “negative potential”).\n- Particle and ordering\n  - A is marked with は (topic).\n  - B is immediately followed by ほど (the standard of comparison).\n  - Predicate comes in a negative form.\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register/naturalness\n  - Very common in both spoken and written Japanese.\n  - じゃない／くないです are polite-casual; ではありません／くありません are more formal.\n- Semantic scope\n  - Used with gradable qualities (size, speed, difficulty, frequency, skill, amount, etc.) and with verbs to compare frequency/habit/amount.\n  - B is the benchmark; the sentence asserts A falls short of that benchmark.\n- Variants and nuance\n  - Inserting は after ほど softens/limits the comparison.\n  - ほどではない／ほどでもない downplay the degree more gently (“not to that extent”).\n- Orthography\n  - ほど may appear as 程 in writing; kana (ほど) is common at this level.\n  - ではない vs じゃない: ではない is neutral/formal; じゃない is casual.\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Using より with a negative to mean “not as … as” (AはBより〜ない). Use AはBほど〜ない instead.\n- Forming な-adjectives like 〜くない (incorrect). な-adj takes 〜ではない/じゃない; い-adj takes 〜くない.\n- Treating the verb part as a “negative potential” by default. The pattern requires plain negative; use potential only when contrasting ability.\n- Putting ほど on the wrong item. ほど marks the higher benchmark (B), not the lower one (A).\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- A より B のほうが〜: States superiority directly (“B is more … than A”); ほど〜ない states inferiority (“A is not as … as B”).\n- ほどではない／ほどでもない: “Not to that extent”; weaker than a direct negative comparison.\n- くらい／ぐらい: Degree marker similar to ほど; in negative comparisons, ほど is more common/natural.\n- それほど〜ない／たいして〜ない／あまり〜ない: General downplaying without naming a specific comparator (different focus, but often used in similar contexts).",
