  "explanation": "### Name\n- 〜てもらう\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Expresses receiving the benefit of someone’s action; “to have someone do (for me/us/the recipient).”\n- Focus is on the recipient’s point of view and the favor/benefit received.\n\n### Form and templates\n- Core:\n  - V(て) + もらう\n- With participants:\n  - N(受け手) は/が N(施し手) に/から V(て) + もらう\n  - (受け手が文脈で明らかな場合は省略可。多くは話し手＝受け手)\n- Politeness/tense:\n  - もらう (plain), もらいます (polite)\n  - もらった／もらいました (past)\n  - もらわない／もらいません (negative)\n- Potential/request:\n  - V(て) + もらえる／もらえます (can receive; often used to make a request)\n  - V(て) + もらえませんか／もらえない？ (polite/casual request)\n  - Negative request: V(ないで) + もらえますか／もらえませんか\n- Progressive/ongoing:\n  - V(て) + もらっている (ongoing/repeated favor)\n- Particle and ordering notes:\n  - 施し手 (the doer) is marked by に or から. に is the default agent marker; から emphasizes “source” and is also common, especially with organizations or when framing it as “from.”\n  - 受け手 is the grammatical subject (が) or topic (は). は topicalizes and can de-emphasize new information.\n  - Objects and other case roles inside the V(て) clause keep their normal particles (を, に, で, から, と, etc.).\n- Verb type:\n  - もらう is a 五段動詞. The embedded verb in て-form can be transitive or intransitive (e.g., “come,” “go,” etc.) as long as a volitional agent performs the action.\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register/naturalness:\n  - Very common in everyday speech and writing. Neutral and widely acceptable with peers.\n  - When the doer is a superior or in formal situations, prefer the humble 〜ていただく to show respect.\n- Perspective:\n  - Centers the recipient’s benefit. Choose 〜てもらう when the recipient (often the speaker or in-group) is the subject. If you want the doer as subject, use 〜てくれる instead.\n- Semantics:\n  - Implies a favor or help (positive for the recipient). Can be arranged, requested, or simply received; context decides whether it was asked for.\n  - Typically involves a volitional doer; avoid using it with non-volitional events as the “giver.”\n- Requests:\n  - 〜てもらえますか／〜てもらえませんか is a polite way to ask for help. Negative-polite (〜ませんか) is softer.\n  - Casual requests: 〜てもらえる？ or 〜てもらう？ (the latter can sound a bit pushy depending on tone).\n- Orthography:\n  - もらう and いただく are commonly written in kana in contemporary writing. いただく is the polite/humble counterpart.\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Marking the doer with を instead of に/から.\n- Confusing direction: using 〜てもらう when you mean “I do for someone” (use 〜てあげる), or using 〜てくれる when the recipient should be the subject.\n- Overusing 〜てもらう with superiors; use 〜ていただく to be appropriately humble.\n- Using 〜てもらう for non-volitional or clearly non-beneficial events.\n- Forgetting that the embedded verb keeps its own case particles for its objects/adjuncts.\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- 〜てくれる: Same benefactive idea from the doer’s viewpoint (doer is subject). Often used for direct requests to the doer.\n- 〜てあげる: The speaker/doer performs a favor for someone else (giving direction).\n- 〜ていただく: Humble version of 〜てもらう; preferred with superiors and in formal settings.\n- 〜てほしい: Expresses desire for someone to do something; does not assert that the action actually happens (unlike 〜てもらう, which describes receiving the action).\n- 〜させてもらう: “Be allowed to do” (receive permission to do something oneself); combines the causative with もらう.",
