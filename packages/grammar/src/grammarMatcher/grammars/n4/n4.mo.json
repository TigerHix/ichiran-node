  "explanation": "### Name\n- も（追加）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Adds an item to an already mentioned or implied set: “also,” “too,” “as well.”\n- Can carry emphasis like “even,” especially with quantities/counters or when used with negation (“not even …”).\n\n### Form and templates\n- N + も\n  - Core additive pattern.\n  - With case markers:\n    - が／を／は are replaced by も: N + も\n    - に／へ／で／から／まで／と／より take も after them: Nにも／Nへも／Nでも／Nからも／Nまでも／Nとも／Nよりも\n- AもBも + same predicate\n  - Lists multiple items that share the same action/state (“both A and B …”).\n  - With a negative predicate: “neither A nor B …”\n- Number/counter + も + predicate\n  - Positive: emphasis (“as many/much as …”).\n  - Negative: “not even …” (e.g., not even one/once).\n- Verb/adjective content as the “thing” being added\n  - V(dict/ない/た) + の／こと + も … (nominalize the clause, then add も)\n  - い-adj + の + も … (refers to “the one(s) that are …” as a noun, then add も)\n  - い-adj(〜く) + も + ない / な-adj + でも + ない\n    - Fixed negative patterns meaning “not even …” or, in paired form 〜くも〜くもない, “neither … nor …”\n- Positioning\n  - Attach も directly to the focused element (the item that is “also/too”).\n  - Sentence-initial topical use is possible: [focused phrase] + も、… (do not combine with は there).\n- Politeness/conjugation\n  - も does not conjugate; it works with both plain and です／ます predicates.\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register/frequency: Neutral, very common in speech and writing; natural at all politeness levels.\n- Scope/focus: Moving も changes what is being added; place it immediately after the element you want to mark.\n- Particle behavior:\n  - Replace は／が／を with も.\n  - Stack も after other case/relational particles (に／へ／で／から／まで／と／より).\n- Multiple も: Using も on more than one element in the same clause is common to express “both/all.”\n- Interrogatives + も:\n  - With a negative predicate: “none/no …” (e.g., 誰も…ない, 何も…ない).\n  - With an affirmative predicate: “every/any …” (e.g., いつも, どこも) — common fixed expressions at this level.\n- Orthography: Always written も (hiragana).\n\n### Common mistakes\n- Stacking は／が／を before も (e.g., Xはも/がも/をも). Use Xも (も replaces them).\n- Placing も in the wrong spot, accidentally changing the focus of “also.”\n- Trying to put も after です／ます. Attach も to the noun/phrase before the copula (or use で + も when appropriate).\n- Using も to connect full sentences; use sentence connectors like また／それに for sentence-level “also.”\n\n### Related grammar\n- は: Topic/contrast marker. も is additive; it includes another item in the same set rather than contrasting.\n- さえ／まで: “Even” with stronger sense of extremity/limit; さえ is more focused than も.\n- また／それに: Sentence-level “also/in addition” (adverbs/conjunctives), not a particle on a noun.\n- AもBも vs AとB: AもBも emphasizes that both share the same predicate; と simply joins items as a combined NP.\n- でも: Can be で + も after nouns/な-adjectives, but also forms other meanings (“even if,” “or something”); don’t confuse with plain additive も.",
