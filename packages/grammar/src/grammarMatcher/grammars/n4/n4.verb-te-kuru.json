  "explanation": "### Name\n- 〜てくる（過去→現在の変化）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Marks an action or change that began in the past and is now reaching or affecting the present: “has started to,” “has come to (do/be),” “is becoming.”\n- Often expresses gradual or natural developments (feelings, weather, visibility, understanding, increase/decrease).\n- Also works as a present-perfect-like “have been doing (up to now).”\n\n### Form and templates\n- V(て) + くる\n- い-adj(〜く) + なってくる\n- な-adj + になってくる\n- N + になってくる\n- Tense/politeness:\n  - Nonpast: 〜てくる (change moving toward “now” or very near future)\n  - Past/perfect: 〜てきた (from past up to the present)\n  - Negative: 〜てこない (“has not come to ~,” “hasn’t started ~”)\n  - Polite: 〜てきます／〜てきました／〜てきません\n- Negative-change patterns:\n  - V(ない形) + なくなってくる\n  - い-adj(〜く) + なくなってくる\n  - な-adj／N + じゃ(では)なくなってくる\n- Common adverbs with gradual change: だんだん・少しずつ・次第に・ますます (optional, placed before the predicate).\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register: Neutral and very common in speech and writing; polite forms as needed.\n- Time/Direction nuance:\n  - 〜てくる: change/process oriented “toward here/now,” often already underway and reaching the present.\n  - 〜てきた: emphasizes the path from earlier time up to the present result.\n  - For changes expected mainly after now (future-oriented), 〜ていく is usually preferred.\n- Typical with intransitive or change-of-state predicates (rise/fall, become clear/visible, come to understand, feelings emerging).\n- Onset vs. continuation:\n  - Instantaneous/natural onsets use 〜てきた to mean “it has (just) begun (and is now happening).”\n  - Gradual development often co-occurs with adverbs like だんだん／少しずつ.\n- Do not confuse with literal movement/bringing uses of くる:\n  - V(て) + くる can also mean “go do V and come back” or “bring (to here)” depending on context. The grammar point here focuses on temporal/aspectual “coming toward now,” not physical movement.\n- Orthography:\n  - Usually written in kana: 〜てくる／〜てきた／〜てこない. Kanji 来る is acceptable (〜て来る) but less common in this auxiliary use.\n  - Casual speech may contract 〜てくる to 〜てく; avoid in writing/formal contexts.\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Attaching 〜てくる directly to adjectives or nouns without なる (use 〜く/〜に + なってくる).\n- Using 〜てくる for changes that mainly unfold after now; use 〜ていく for future-oriented progression.\n- Using 〜てくる when the meaning needed is literal “bring/come” (context decides; check whether the focus is time/aspect or physical movement).\n- Confusing 〜てくる and 〜てきた: use 〜てきた for “from before until now,” not 〜てくる.\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- 〜ていく: Future/away orientation; “will continue (from now),” “is getting ~ (as time goes on).”\n- 〜始める: Plain “begin to ~” (starting point focus), without the “toward now” nuance.\n- 〜ようになる: “Come to be able to/do (as a habit)”—describes acquisition of ability/habitual change, not just any gradual change.\n- 〜続ける: “Continue to ~”—focus on ongoing continuation rather than onset or approach to the present.\n- 〜出す: Sudden onset; contrasts with the typically gradual/natural feel of 〜てくる.",
