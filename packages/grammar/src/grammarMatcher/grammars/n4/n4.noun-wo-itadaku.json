  "explanation": "### Name\n- Nをいただく（もらうの謙譲語）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Humbly states that the speaker or their in‑group receives or accepts something from someone, showing respect to the giver. Often used in business/formal contexts and in thank‑you/acceptance messages.\n- Also used with edible/drinkable nouns to mean “to eat/drink” humbly; context decides which meaning is intended.\n- Potential form is used for polite requests meaning “May I receive/have …?”\n\n### Form and templates\n- Core\n  - N を いただく\n  - 人・組織 に／から N を いただく\n- Polite/past/negative\n  - N を いただきます（polite non‑past）\n  - N を いただきました（polite past）\n  - N を いただきません／いただかない（polite/plain negative）\n- Request/refusal (potential)\n  - N を いただけますか／いただけますでしょうか（polite request）\n  - N は いただけません（polite refusal/“cannot accept”）\n- Honorific prefix on the received item (optional)\n  - お／ご＋N を いただく（attach お to native Japanese nouns, ご to Sino‑Japanese; do not attach to most loanwords/proper nouns）\n- Particles and ordering\n  - Direct object: を\n  - Giver: に or から（both acceptable; から is slightly broader and common with organizations; に feels more direct/personal）\n  - Topicization is possible: N は … いただく（topic は replaces を when topicalized）\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register/naturalness\n  - 謙譲語 (humble language). Use when the receiver is “I/we/our company” to elevate the giver. Very common in formal speech/writing; switch to もらう in casual settings.\n- Subject constraint\n  - The subject should be the speaker or their in‑group. Do not use いただく to describe an out‑group/superior receiving something; that would inappropriately humble them.\n- Semantic scope\n  - Accepting/receiving both tangible items and intangible things (e.g., information, help, response). With food/drink nouns it can mean “eat/drink” humbly; rely on context.\n- Orthography\n  - いただく/いただきます are commonly written in kana in modern business writing. The kanji 頂く is seen but often avoided for politeness/uniformity. The mealtime set phrase いただきます is conventionally in kana.\n- Politeness upgrades\n  - Combine with お／ご on the item related to the giver for added respect. You may also combine with polite subject references for your side (e.g., 弊社、私ども) in formal contexts.\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Using いただく when the receiver is a customer/teacher/client (out‑group). Use the giver‑honoring side (くださる) or an honorific for their receiving (e.g., お受け取りになる) instead.\n- Marking the item with が instead of を; receiving takes a direct object.\n- Misusing に vs から: both are allowed, but から is more general; に feels more personal/agentive.\n- Over‑attaching お／ご to nouns where it is unnatural (many loanwords/proper nouns). Use only where conventional.\n- Overusing いただく in casual talk, which can sound stiff or distant.\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- N を もらう: Plain “receive.” Use in casual/neutral contexts; lacks the humble nuance.\n- N を くださる: Honorific “give” from the respected giver’s viewpoint; subject is the giver.\n- V‑て いただく: Humble “have someone do (for me/us).” Action, not a thing, is received.\n- N を 頂戴する／N を ちょうだい: 頂戴する is formal/stiff written equivalent; ちょうだい is casual request (“give me”), often used in informal speech.\n- 受け取る: Neutral “to receive/take delivery,” focusing on the act, without humility/respect.",
