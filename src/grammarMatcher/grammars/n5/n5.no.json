  "explanation": "### Name\n- の（所有・説明の「の」）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Links two nouns, where the second noun (head) is defined by the first: “‘s” or “of”\n- Broadly marks possession/affiliation, category/type, origin/location/time, material/content, and apposition (“the N2 which is N1”)\n\n### Form and templates\n- Core\n  - N1 の N2\n  - (N1 の N2) の N3 … (chaining; the final noun is the head)\n  - N1 の（ellipsis of the head noun; “N1’s one” when context makes the head clear）\n- As predicate\n  - N1 の N2 です／だ（politeness set by the sentence ending, not by の）\n- Particle placement and order\n  - Attach case/topic particles after the head noun: N1 の N2 が／を／に／へ／と／で／から／まで／より／は …\n  - Do not insert other particles between N1 and の, or between の and N2\n- What can be N1\n  - Nouns, proper names, pronouns, numeral+counter phrases, short noun phrases\n  - Demonstratives: prefer この／その／あの + N (rather than これ／それ／あれ + の + N in basic use)\n- What cannot be N1 in this pattern\n  - い-adjectives and verbs do not take の to modify a noun (use い-adj + N, or V(plain) + N)\n  - な-adjectives use な before a noun (Aな + N), not の\n  - No copula before の (× Nだ の N; use N の N)\n- Optional/alternative nuances for N1 の N2\n  - Possession/affiliation (ownership, family, membership)\n  - Description/classification (type, characteristic, field)\n  - Origin/location/time (“from/in/at/during” nuances)\n  - Material/content/purpose (“made of,” “containing,” “for”)\n  - Apposition (“N2, which is N1,” e.g., role/occupation/position)\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register/naturalness\n  - Neutral and ubiquitous in all registers; extremely common at every level\n  - Chaining many の is grammatical but can become heavy; prefer shorter chains or relative clauses for clarity\n- Semantic scope\n  - の is flexible; it does not always mean literal possession—interpret by context (type, origin, material, content, role, etc.)\n  - In apposition, N1 restates/identifies what N2 is (often professions, roles, relationships)\n- Structural constraints\n  - The head is always the final noun; earlier nouns restrict/describe it\n  - Titles and fixed name-like compounds sometimes omit の; learners can generally keep の unless a well-known fixed form exists\n- Orthography\n  - の is written in hiragana in modern Japanese\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Reversing English “of” order (placing the head first); in Japanese the descriptor/possessor comes before the head\n- Inserting case particles between N1 and の, or between の and N2\n- Using だ／です or な before の between two nouns (use N の N)\n- Forcing の after い-adjectives or verb forms to modify a noun (use い-adj + N, or V(plain) + N)\n- Overusing これ／それ／あれ + の + N; use この／その／あの + N for basic noun modification\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- い-adj + N: adjective directly modifies a noun; no の\n- な-adj + な + N: adjectival noun modifies a noun with な, not の\n- V(plain) + N: relative clause noun modification (no の)\n- N がある／いる: “have/exist” to express possession as existence, not as a noun–noun link\n- という + N: “(a) N called …”; names/labels rather than possession/description",
