  "explanation": "### Name\n- もっと\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Marks “more,” “to a greater degree,” or “even more” of an action, state, amount, or frequency compared with a current/expected level or a previously mentioned one. Used for requests, intentions, suggestions, and comparisons.\n\n### Form and templates\n- もっと + V\n  - Do V to a greater extent/degree. Common with 〜たい, 〜てください, 〜ましょう, 〜なければならない, 〜ようになる, etc.\n- N を もっと + V / もっと + N を + V\n  - Both orders are natural. Place もっと immediately before the part you want to increase (verb phrase or the object).\n- もっと + い-adj\n  - “More Adj.” As an adverb modifying a verb: もっと + い-adj(〜く) + V.\n- もっと + な-adj\n  - Predicate: もっと + な-adj + だ/です. Adverbial: もっと + な-adj(に) + V. Attributive: もっと + な-adj + な + N.\n- (A は B より) もっと + Adj/Adv\n  - Optional emphasis in a comparative. At the beginner level, prefer either より or もっと; avoid stacking unless you need emphasis.\n- Quantities (formal/written option): もっと + 多く(の N)\n  - In everyday speech, prefer counters with もう/あと for “another/extra X” (see Usage notes).\n\nParticle requirements and ordering\n- With objects: N を もっと V or もっと N を V.\n- With subjects/needed amounts: N が もっと 必要だ／ほしい.\n- Place もっと directly before the element you want to increase: before a verb, an adverb, or an adjective (or before the object if you want “more of that object”).\n- Conjugation/inflection\n  - もっと itself does not inflect. Conjugate the verb/adjective normally for tense and politeness.\n  - Use い-adj → 〜く and な-adj → 〜に when modifying verbs adverbially.\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register and frequency: Very common and neutral in speech and writing. Works in both plain and polite styles by changing the main predicate, not もっと.\n- Semantic scope: Signals an increase relative to a contextually understood baseline (now, earlier, previous amount, or an item just mentioned). Without an explicit comparator, the listener infers it from context.\n- Scope/placement: もっと modifies what follows. Put it immediately before the word or phrase whose degree/amount you want to raise to avoid ambiguity.\n- Degree nuance:\n  - もっと = simply “more/further.”\n  - For “a little more,” prefer もう少し／もうちょっと.\n  - For “much more/by far,” ずっと is common.\n- Quantities and counters:\n  - For “another/extra + number + counter,” use もう／あと + numeral + counter.\n  - Avoid もっと + numeral + counter in everyday speech.\n  - もっと may combine with 多く (の N) in formal/written contexts to mean “more N (in number/amount).”\n- With nouns: もっと is an adverb; do not place it directly before a bare noun to modify it like an adjective. Use patterns such as N を もっと V, N が もっと 必要だ／ほしい, or formal もっと多くの N.\n- Comparatives:\n  - A は B より Adj is the basic comparative. Adding もっと gives emphasis: A は B より もっと Adj (acceptable, but beginners can avoid the stack unless emphasizing).\n- Orthography:\n  - もっと is written in kana.\n  - Do not confuse with もっとも:\n    - 最も (もっとも) = “the most” (superlative).\n    - 尤も (もっとも) = “indeed; quite reasonable.”\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Using もっと with counters for “another/extra X.” Use もう／あと + numeral + counter instead.\n- Placing もっと far from the element you want to increase, causing scope ambiguity. Keep it directly before the target word/phrase.\n- Trying to use もっと directly before a noun as if it were an adjective (e.g., “more N”). Use N を もっと V, N が もっと 必要だ／ほしい, or もっと多くの N (formal).\n- Confusing もっと (“more”) with 最も/尤も (both read もっとも).\n- Redundantly stacking より and もっと at beginner level; pick one unless emphasizing.\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- もう: “already/anymore,” and with counters means “another/extra.” もう少し／もうちょっと = “a little more.”\n- ずっと: “by far/much more” (stronger degree) and also “continuously.”\n- さらに／一層: “even more; furthermore” (more formal/literary than もっと).\n- より: Marks the comparator “than.” もっと adds intensity; より marks the comparison.",
