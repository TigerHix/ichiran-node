  "explanation": "### Name\n- AはBが〜（トピック・主語）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Introduces A as the overall topic, then states a fact/feature about A by marking B as the grammatical subject of the predicate. Often corresponds to “As for A, B is/does …” or “A has B that …” in English. Common for describing characteristics, parts, possession/existence, preferences, and abilities.\n\n### Form and templates\n- Core\n  - A(N) は B(N) が Predicate\n- Predicate types\n  - い-adj／な-adj＋だ・です\n  - V（intransitive, potential, or verbs that select が such as “understand,” “can,” “exist,” etc.）\n  - N ＋ だ・です\n- Particle requirements and ordering\n  - Topic: は after A\n    - If A also needs another case, attach は to it: A に は / A で は (e.g., topic-as-location/time/context)\n  - Subject inside the comment: が after B\n  - Fixed order: [A は] → [B が] → [Predicate]\n- Optional sentence ending\n  - 〜か: yes/no question (polite/formal marking of a question)\n  - 〜かね: self-directed/pondering question; soft/ruminative nuance\n- Conjugation/inflection\n  - Only the predicate conjugates for tense/polarity and politeness (〜です／〜ます). \n  - な-adj are predicative with だ／です (not “だです”).\n  - い-adj conjugate as usual.\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register, frequency, naturalness\n  - Neutral and extremely common in both speech and writing. Works with plain or polite predicates.\n- Semantic scope\n  - は sets the discourse topic (domain/possessor/experiencer/place/time), and within that scope が marks the subject that directly pairs with the predicate.\n  - Typical uses:\n    - Preferences/feelings/abilities: A (experiencer) は B が 好き／嫌い／分かる／できる／欲しい／必要 など\n    - Parts/attributes: A (whole/person) は B (part/feature) が 大きい／痛い／多い／少ない など\n    - Existence/possession/availability: A (place/domain) は/には B が ある／いる\n  - Important: Lexicalized body-part expressions (fixed idioms) like 頭が痛い, 目が悪い, お腹が空いた are NOT examples of compositional AはBが structure. These are stored in the lexicon as complete predicates and don't demonstrate the grammatical pattern being taught here. This pattern is for compositional topic-comment constructions where the parts are freely combined.\n- Particle choice\n  - Use が for B when the predicate lexically selects が (e.g., 好き・嫌い・上手・下手・分かる・できる・ある・いる・欲しい・必要・多い・少ない).\n  - Using は on B instead changes the meaning to contrast/given-topic and is not the same pattern.\n- Orthography\n  - Topic particle は is written は but pronounced “wa.”\n  - 〜かね is conventional; casual speech often prefers 〜かな, and polite soft questions often use 〜でしょうか (see Related).\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Replacing B が with B を with predicates that require が (e.g., “understand,” “can,” “like,” “exist”).\n- Marking both A and B with は (“AはBは…”) leads to odd or contrastive readings; keep が on B in this pattern.\n- Omitting が after B when the predicate needs a subject marker makes the sentence unclear or ungrammatical.\n- Using “な-adj＋だです” (should be な-adj＋です or な-adj＋だ).\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- Aが〜: Subject-only statement; no separate discourse topic is set by は.\n- AはBです: Simple topic–copula; states equivalence/category, not an internal が-subject feature.\n- AにBがある／いる: Existence pattern with location/time marked by に; often appears as AにはBがある／いる when A is also the topic.\n- AはBをV: Transitive pattern with を as direct object; contrasts with predicates that require が.\n- 〜かな／〜でしょうか: Alternatives to sentence-final 〜か／〜かね (casual wonder vs. polite/soft inquiry).",
