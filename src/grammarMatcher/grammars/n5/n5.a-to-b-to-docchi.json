  "explanation": "### Name\n- AとBとどっち／どちら\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Asking which of two options is preferred, better, larger, chosen, etc.\n- Equivalent to “Which (one), A or B?” or “Between A and B, which is 〜?”\n\n### Form and templates\n- Core\n  - N1 と N2 と どっち が 〜?\n  - N1 と N2 と どちら が 〜? (politer)\n- Case particle after どっち／どちら depends on the predicate\n  - が for subject-of-comparison with adjectives/stative predicates (e.g., better, faster,好き)\n  - を for direct objects (choose/buy/eat, etc.)\n  - に／で／へ, etc., as required by the verb or expression\n- Polite vs casual\n  - どちら = polite/formal; use with です／ます\n  - どっち = casual/informal\n- Alternatives/variants\n  - N1 と N2 では どちら が 〜? (or とでは) emphasizes “between A and B”\n  - N1 と N2 、どっち が 〜? (dropping the second と is common in casual speech)\n  - どっちの N／どちらの N …? for “which N (of the two)”\n  - どっち（どちら）のほうが 〜? to ask “which is more 〜”\n- Conjugation/inflection\n  - No special conjugation for どっち／どちら; follow normal adjective/verb/polite forms in the predicate\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Use only when exactly two options are in play; for 3+ options, use どれ or どのN\n- Register\n  - どちら is neutral–polite and safe in formal settings\n  - どっち is very casual; avoid in formal or business contexts\n- Particle behavior\n  - Keep the case particle after どっち／どちら as required (が/を/に/で, etc.); in casual speech it’s often dropped, but include it in careful Japanese\n- Enumeration particle\n  - The “A and B” list uses と; the second と before どっち／どちら is textbook/careful style\n  - In casual conversation, the second と is often omitted; alternatively, では can topicalize the pair (…では どちら…)\n- Scope/semantics\n  - Asks for selection or comparative judgment within the two named items\n- Orthography\n  - どっち／どちら are normally written in hiragana; the kanji 何方 is rare and best avoided in modern learning materials\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Using どっち／どちら when there are more than two choices; use どれ／どのN instead\n- Dropping the required case particle after どっち／どちら in formal speech/writing\n- Mixing particles (e.g., using か inside this pattern in formal contexts); prefer と for the two-item set in careful Japanese\n- Using は after どっち／どちら in place of the needed case particle; use が/を/に/で as required\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- どれ: “which (one)” among three or more; pronoun\n- どのN: “which N” before a noun (3+); for two specifically, prefer どっちのN／どちらのN\n- AよりB（のほうが）〜: comparative statement pattern; used for answers/statements rather than the two-option question\n- N1 と N2 では 〜: “Between A and B, …” framing used for statements or questions with どちらが〜?",
