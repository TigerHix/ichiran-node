  "explanation": "### Name\n- 〜みたいだ（比喩・推量）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Similarity/likeness: “like; as if; resembles”\n- Conjecture/inference based on appearance or information: “seems; looks; apparently” (speaker’s guess, not a firm statement)\n\n### Form and templates\n- V(plain) + みたいだ／です\n- い-adj + みたいだ／です\n- な-adj + みたいだ／です\n- N + みたいだ／です\n- Modifier uses (treat みたい as a な-adjective):\n  - X + みたいな + N（“a N like X”）\n  - X + みたいに + V/adj（“do/be … like X”）\n- Politeness:\n  - Casual: みたいだ／みたい（だ dropped in very casual speech）\n  - Polite: みたいです\n- Negation and past:\n  - Internal negation (what seems is negative): V(ない)／い-adj(くない)／な-adj・N(じゃない) + みたいだ\n  - External negation (deny the seeming itself): X + みたいではない／みたいじゃない（casual）\n  - Past situation: V(た)／な-adj・N(だった) + みたいだ\n  - Past judgment: X + みたいだった\n  - Past negative: X + みたいじゃなかった／みたいではなかった\n- Particle behavior and ordering:\n  - Case/topic particles (は・が・を・に・で・と etc.) appear as usual before the phrase containing みたいだ; みたい itself does not require a special particle.\n  - With N/な-adj in the present, do not insert だ before みたい（N／な-adj + みたいだ）; for past, use だった + みたいだ.\n- Clause scope:\n  - みたい attaches to the entire preceding clause or phrase.\n- Connective:\n  - みたいで can connect to a following clause (like the て-form of a な-adjective).\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register/naturalness:\n  - Very common in spoken Japanese; neutral to casual. みたいです is acceptable in polite conversation.\n  - In formal writing or presentations, ようだ／ようです is preferred over みたいだ.\n- Semantics:\n  - Conjecture is based on visible clues, context, or heard information; it is the speaker’s inference (not a direct quote).\n  - For immediate outward appearance (“looks …” about imminent change or degree of an adjective), 〜そうだ（様態）often sounds more precise.\n  - For direct hearsay (“I heard that …”), use 〜そうだ（伝聞） or ～と言っていた rather than みたいだ.\n  - Similarity use marks resemblance/analogy; it does not assert identity.\n- Orthography and variants:\n  - みたい is typically written in hiragana. Do not confuse with the verb 見たい (“want to see”), which uses the kanji 見.\n  - Intensifiers/adverbs that frequently co-occur: どうやら（inference), まるで（strong “as if” simile).\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Inserting の before みたい with nouns: use N + みたいだ (contrast: N の ようだ with ようだ).\n- Attaching みたい to a verb stem or ます-form; it must follow the plain form (dictionary, ない, た, etc.).\n- Forgetting な when modifying a noun: use みたいな + N (not みたいだ + N).\n- Misplacing negation: when you mean “seems not to …”, use internal negation (…ない + みたいだ) rather than defaulting to …みたいじゃない.\n- Overusing みたいだ in formal contexts where ようだ／ようです is expected.\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- 〜ようだ／〜ようです: Similar meaning but more formal/objective; with nouns often uses N の ようだ; modifier forms ような／ように.\n- 〜らしい: Hearsay from reliable sources or “typical of” someone/something; less subjective than みたい in inference use.\n- 〜っぽい: Colloquial “-ish”/tendency; often about characteristic or feel, not full-clause inference.\n- 〜そうだ（様態）: “Looks/likely to …” based on appearance; forms from Vます-stem／adj stem; not used with nouns.\n- 〜そうだ（伝聞）: “I hear that …”; reports information from a source, unlike the inferential みたいだ.",
