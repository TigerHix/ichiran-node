  "explanation": "### Name\n- 使役受け身（〜させられる）\n\n### Meaning and function\n- Expresses being made/forced/compelled to do an action by someone or something external. Often carries an unwilling, burdensome, or imposed nuance. The causer can be a person, group, rule, situation, etc.\n\n### Form and templates\n- Core template:\n  - N(forced person) は/が + N(causer) に + [optional object etc.] + V(使役受け身)\n- Ichidan (〜る verbs):\n  - V(ます-stem) + させられる\n- Godan (う-verbs):\n  - Long form (neutral/formal): V(未然形＝あ段) + せられる\n  - Colloquial contraction: V(未然形＝あ段) + される\n    - Note: The contraction after -す verbs (…さされる) is often avoided; use …させられる.\n- Irregular:\n  - する → させられる\n  - くる → こさせられる\n- Particle requirements and ordering:\n  - Forced person: が/は\n  - Causer: に (により／によって is possible but sounds stiff here)\n  - Direct object of the action: を (and other case markers as usual)\n- Conjugation:\n  - Treat 〜させられる as an Ichidan ending: 〜させられます, 〜させられない, 〜させられた, 〜させられて, etc.\n- Alternative morphology notes:\n  - Godan long forms can appear as …せられる or …させられる; …させられる is common in modern usage.\n  - The colloquial …される (contraction) is common for many godan verbs except -す verbs; avoid in formal writing.\n\n### Usage notes and constraints\n- Register and naturalness:\n  - Common in both speech and writing. The long form (…せられる／…させられる) is safe in all registers.\n  - The contraction …される is natural in casual speech (avoid especially after -す verbs and in formal texts).\n- Semantics:\n  - The subject is the person who ends up doing the action; the causer (に) imposes it.\n  - Often implies unwillingness or burden. If you want “allowed/let me do,” use 〜させてもらう／〜させてくれる instead.\n  - Distinct from simple passive 〜られる, which describes being acted upon rather than being compelled to act yourself.\n- Agent marking:\n  - に is standard for the causer; によって sounds formal/stiff and is less common with 使役受け身.\n  - The causer is frequently omitted when obvious or when focusing on the burdened experience.\n- Verb type constraints:\n  - Works with transitive and many intransitive verbs that denote controllable actions.\n  - Do not confuse with potential 〜られる; 〜させられる always encodes external compulsion, not ability.\n- Orthography:\n  - させられる／こさせられる are typically written in kana.\n  - The long godan variant …せられる may appear in more formal writing; …させられる is more common overall.\n\n### Common mistakes (optional, only if relevant)\n- Marking the causer with を or から; the causer should be に (により／によって only in formal contexts).\n- Using the colloquial contraction …される with Ichidan or する/くる verbs (×食べされる, ×しされる, ×こされる).\n- Using …さされる after -す verbs; prefer …させられる.\n- Using simple passive 〜られる when the meaning is “made to do,” which requires 〜させられる.\n- Assuming 〜させられる expresses permission; for “allowed to,” use 〜させてもらう／〜させてくれる.\n\n### Related grammar (optional, only if relevant)\n- 〜させる（使役）: “make/let someone do.” Focuses on the causer; not passive.\n- 〜られる（受け身）: Simple passive/adversative passive; being acted upon or adversely affected, not compelled to act.\n- 〜させてもらう／〜させてくれる: Permission/benefit (“be allowed to do”), contrasts with forced/compelled nuance.\n- 〜なければならない／〜なくてはいけない: Obligation by rules/necessity, not necessarily imposed by a specific causer.\n- 〜ことになる: Outcome decided by circumstances/others; softer and less “forced” than 〜させられる in many contexts.",
